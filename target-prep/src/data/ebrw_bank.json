    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically completes the text\u2019 s discussion of the diff erent counts of species in the Mediterr anean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues r epor ted almost double the number of species that Bianchi and Morri r epor ted in their study ten y ears earlier . Accor ding t o the text, this diff erence can only be par tly attributed t o new inv ertebrate species being described in the y ears between the two studies, which means ther e must be an additional fact or that made Coll and colleagues\u2019 count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri\u2019 s count. The text goes on t o explain that fact or: resear chers ha ve a r elativ ely poor understanding of micr oorganisms\u2019 morphological v ariability , or the diff erences in micr oorganisms\u2019 structur e and form. This poor understanding mak es it har d to classify micr oorganisms b y species and means that r esear chers\u2019 decisions about classifying micr oorganisms can ha ve a lar ge eff ect on the o verall species counts that resear chers r epor t. Additionally , the text sa ys that the two censuses r epor ted similar numbers of v ertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the diff erence in o verall species did not come fr om diff erences in those categories. Giv en all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues ma y have treated some of the diff erences among micr oorganisms as indicativ e of the micr oorganisms being diff erent species, wher eas Bianchi and Morri tr eated those diff erences as v ariations within species, r esulting in Coll and colleagues r epor ting many mor e species than Bianchi and Morri did. Choice A is incorr ect because the text explicitly addr esses this issue b y stating that the description of new inv ertebrate species in the y ears between the two studies can explain only par t of the diff erence in the number of species r epor ted b y the studies. The focus of the text is on explaining the diff erence between Coll and colleagues\u2019 count and Bianchi and Morri\u2019 s count that cannot be accounted for b y the inclusion of inv ertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri\u2019 s study .\u00a0Choice C is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri ma y have been less sensitiv e to how much the form and structur e of micr oorganisms v ary within the same species than Coll and colleagues wer e. If Bianchi and Morri had been less InferencesDi\ufb03culty than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity t o within-species v ariation would lead r esear chers t o classify as diff erent species micr oorganisms that mor e sensitiv e resear chers would classify as v ariations within the same species. The text indicates, howe ver, that Bianchi and Morri r epor ted far f ewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also ex cludes other explanations for this diff erence, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri wer e mor e sensitiv e to within-species v ariation than Coll and colleagues wer e, leading Bianchi and Morri t o repor t fewer o verall species.\u00a0Choice D is incorr ect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues r epor ted many mor e species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an under estimate of the number of micr oorganism species b y Coll and colleagues would not explain that diff erence\u2014it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should ha ve been e ven lar ger.",

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the gr aph t o complete the student\u2019 s conclusion about beehiv e structur e. The text explains that in the hiv es of hone ybees, the hexagonal cells housing dr one eggs ar e lar ger than the hexagonal cells housing work er eggs, and that this siz e diff erence r esults in a construction pr oblem that the bees addr ess b y using nonhexagonal cells t o \ufb01ll gaps between sections of dr one-egg cells and work er-egg cells. The text also states that the siz e difference between dr one-egg cells and work er-egg cells v aries b y species of hone ybee. The gr aph displa ys data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hiv es of thr ee species. In the hiv es of the western hone ybee, the per centages of \ufb01v e- sided, se ven-sided, and eight-sided cells ar e all less than 0.5%. But in the hiv es of the black dwar f hone ybee, the per centages of \ufb01ve-sided and se ven-sided cells ar e higher than those for the western hone ybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwar f hone ybee, the per centages of \ufb01v e-sided and se ven-sided cells ar e also higher than those for the western hone ybee: slightly o ver 2.5% and slightly o ver 2.0%, r espectiv ely; additionally , the dwar f hone ybee possesses a higher per centage of eight-sided cells than the western hone ybee does. Taken alt ogether , the gr aph shows that the hiv es of the western hone ybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hiv es of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only t o solv e the construction pr oblem arising fr om the diff erence in siz e between dr one-egg cells and work er-egg cells, a smaller per centage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller siz e diff erence between the two types of cells. Ther efore, it can be concluded fr om the data that work er-egg cells ar e probably closer in siz e to drone-egg cells in the hiv es of the western hone ybee than in the hiv es of the other two species. Choice B is incorr ect because, as the text states, hone ybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western hone ybee and black dwar f hone ybee wouldn \u2019t deposit dr one eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwar f hone ybee wouldn \u2019t deposit dr one eggs in se ven-sided cells. Choice C is incorr ect. The text explains that hone ybees r ely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hiv es, and the gr aph shows that the western hone ybee r elies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwar f hone ybee does: \ufb01v e-sided, se ven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other wor ds, the western hone ybee and dwar f hone ybee r ely on the same number of geometric shapes. F or the black dwar f hone ybee, the gr aph displa ys data only for \ufb01v e-sided and se ven-sided cells, which suggests a t otal absence of eight-sided cells. Y et this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western hone ybee. Thus, based on the gr aph, it would be inaccur ate t o sa y that the western hone ybee r elies on \" many mor e\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorr ect. As the text explains, hone ybee hiv es consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells ar e used t o connect sections of hexagonal cells of diff erent siz es. Since the gr aph indicates that the per centage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western hone ybee than it is for the dwar f hone ybee or black dwar f hone ybee, the western hone ybee would conv ersely ha ve a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwar f hone ybee or black dwar f hone ybee does, not a lower per centage.",

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it is the choice that most logically completes the text. The text mentions a dialect of Spanish spok en in New Mexico, which was coloniz ed b y Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect diff ers greatly fr om other Spanish dialects in that it still has char acteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects e ventually lost. After asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant fr om Spain \u2019s other colonies, making it less attractiv e to colonists after the initial colonization. This geogr aphic isolation limited the colony \u2019s exposur e to other Spanish colonists who would ha ve other wise intr oduced the changes t o the Spanish language that occurr ed in their r espectiv e colonies.

The text begins b y stating that Tomas and Tereza\u2019s dog Kar enin f elt disrupted b y a recent mo ve because of his dislik e of change. The text then goes on t o suggest that this is because the wa y a dog experiences time diff ers fr om the wa y humans experience time: time for a dog doesn \u2019t mo ve linearly , going \"on and on, fr om one thing t o the next, \" but instead mo ves cir cularly , \"like the hands of a clock. \" That is, time for a dog is experienced as a cy clical pattern char acteriz ed b y routine and pr edictability , with each da y \"following the same path. \" The text then concludes b y providing examples of seemingly insigni\ufb01cant changes in r outine that pr ofoundly \" disturbed [Kar enin\u2019s] sense of time, \" causing him t o feel displeasur e.

Rather , in accounting for Kar enin\u2019s displeasur e with the mo ve to Switz erland, the text explains that Kar enin gener ally has a negativ e response t o any kind of change. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn \u2019t suggest that Kar enin compr ehends time similarly t o how Tomas and Tereza compr ehend it. On the contr ary, the text str ongly implies a contr ast between dogs\u2019 cir cular experience of time with the wa y humans experience time as a str aightfor ward progression that can be \" plotted on a str aight line. \" Choice D is incorr ect because the text pr ovides no indication that a change in the places and objects surr ounding Kar enin causes him t o feel as though time is acceler ating. Although the text does use the language of \" dash[ing] madly ahead\" in r elation t o time, the phr ase appears in the context of a comparison illustr ating how dogs experience time: time for a dog mo ves just as the hands of a clock do, in a cir cle and \"unwilling t o dash madly ahead\"\u2014that is, alwa ys in a r egular and pr edictable wa y.

    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019 s discussion about A ztec (Nahua) ethics. The text indicates that, accor ding t o Pur cell\u2019s interpr etation of a vailable A ztec philosophical works, the A ztec ethical system views an individual\u2019 s actions in r elation t o that individual\u2019 s societal r ole and how the actions aff ect the community .

Thus, Pur cell\u2019s analysis suggests that the A ztecs would ha ve asser ted that the mor ality of an individual\u2019 s actions ar e rooted in that person \u2019s position in the community and the actions\u2019 eff ects and ther efore cannot be determined in the absence of that context. Choice B is incorr ect.

    "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text\u2019 s discussion of Sidonian coins. As the text explains, resear chers determined that Sidonian coins wer e made of silv er and copper and that fr om 450 BCE t o 367 BCE, the per centage of silver in each coin decr eased fr om 98% t o 74.2% while the per centage of copper incr eased fr om 1% t o 24.7%. The text indicates that because the coins containing less than 80% silv er wer en\u2019t consider ed suitable for tr ade (suggesting that copper was less valuable than silv er) and look ed diff erent fr om coins containing mor e silv er, the r esear chers suspect ther e was a serious loss in con\ufb01dence in the curr ency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It\u2019 s reasonable t o assume that it wasn \u2019t possible t o boost con\ufb01dence simply b y devoting a gr eater amount of v aluable silv er to the curr ency , since Sidon was under signi\ufb01cant and ongoing \ufb01nancial pr essur e; howe ver, keeping the t otal amount of silv er the same and r educing the amount of copper in the coins would ha ve resulted in smaller coins with a higher per centage of silv er. Ther efore, it mak es sense t o suggest that Abd\u2019 a\u0161tar t I (the ruler after 367 BCE) lik ely restored con\ufb01dence in the curr ency b y deciding t o keep the amount of silv er in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but t o decr ease the coins\u2019 weight. Choice A is incorr ect because the text conv eys that a crisis in con\ufb01dence in the curr ency of Sidon lik ely occurr ed ar ound 367 BCE because the per centage of silv er in coins had fallen below 80% (pr esumably because Sidon \u2019s \ufb01nancial pr essur es meant that less silver was a vailable for curr ency), making the coins unsuitable for tr ade. Thus, announcing that the thr eshold for the per centage of silver in coins would be r aised\u2014that is, that coins would need t o contain e ven mor e than 80% silv er to be suitable for tr ade\u2014lik ely would ha ve worsened the crisis r ather than r elieved it. Choice C is incorr ect because the text str ongly suggests that a crisis in con\ufb01dence in the curr ency of Sidon was caused b y the pr opor tion of silv er to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being t oo little silv er for the coins t o be consider ed suitable for tr ade; ther efore, it\u2019s unlik ely that minting coins with a similar pr opor tion of silver to copper (that is, still ar ound 74.2% silv er) would ha ve restored con\ufb01dence, e ven if the coins wer e hea vier. Choice D is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that funding the mining of mor e copper would ha ve relieved a crisis in con\ufb01dence in the curr ency of Sidon.

    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion about the genealogy of Ar thurian legends. The text establishes a chr onology of Ar thurian sour ces, with Vita Sancti Cadoci composed in the 11th centur y (the 1000s), Geoffr ey of Monmouth \u2019s History written in the 1130s, W ace\u2019s Roman de Brut in 1155, and Culhwch and Olwen in the second half of the 12th centur y (1150\u20131200). Impor tantly , the text indicates that along with adapting Geoffr ey\u2019s History, Wace added \"the famous Round Table \" to it. If W ace intr oduced the idea of the Round Table in 1155, it logically follows that this element was not pr esent in earlier works. This suggests that the Ar thurian legends that informed Vita Sancti Cadoci , which was written befor e both Geoffr ey\u2019s and Wace\u2019s works, would not ha ve featur ed the Round Table. Choice A is incorr ect because the text discusses se veral works that include legends about a char acter , King Ar thur, but doesn \u2019t addr ess the hist orical accur acy of the st ories in those works or suggest that the cr eation of Culhwch and Olwen was r elevant t o any other works\u2019 accur acy.

The text indicates that Kilburn- Toppin char acteriz es cr aft guild members as people who made and consumed items and wer e \"highly discerning, \" or wer e car eful judges of quality . Because gift giving bene\ufb01ted one \u2019s status and if cr aft guild members wer e par ticularly attentiv e to quality , it follows that gifting handmade items within the guilds\u2014between people who had high standar ds for items the y made and for items they receiv ed\u2014ma y have been a wa y for members t o maintain and enhance their pr ofessional r eputations, or their pr ofessional statuses, among their peers. Choice A is incorr ect because the text emphasiz es the idea that members of guilds par ticipated in gift giving both t o displa y and receiv e social status, suggesting that the gifting of handmade items between the \"highly discerning\" members of cr aft guilds had to do with the members\u2019 inter est in quality and status; nothing in the text suggests that the pr actice of gifting those items within the cr aft guilds was intended t o limit knowledge of materials and techniques t o the members of those guilds. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn \u2019t distinguish between \" ostentatious, \" or v ery showy , and \" prosaic, \" or or dinar y, gifts and because the char acterization at the end of the text per tains speci\ufb01cally t o the gifting of handmade items indicativ e of gr eat taste, not pr osaic items, between members of cr aft guilds. And while the text indicates that London \u2019s lar gest guilds ga ve philanthr opic gifts (donations for humanitarian purposes), it doesn \u2019t indicate whether these gifts would ha ve been consider ed ostentatious.

Text 1 states that micr obes usually thriv e in v ery harsh conditions, and so Fier er\u2019s team was surprised when samples collected fr om an extr emely cold and dr y area of Antar ctica didn \u2019t appear t o contain any lif e. Fier er\u2019s team says that though this doesn \u2019t conclusiv ely pr ove ther e are no micr obes in the ar ea, it suggests that micr obes would ha ve a notably di\ufb03cult time sur viving in the envir onment.

Howe ver, the pr esence of only a f ew micr obes in the Antar ctic samples r ather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would pr esumably be much easier t o detect) would illustr ate conditions in the Antar ctic soil that mak e it di\ufb03cult for micr obes t o thriv e. Since Fier er\u2019s team sa ys that the seeming absence of micr obes in the Antar ctic samples suggests an unusually harsh envir onment and the author of Text 2 sa ys that e ven if ther e are a f ew undetectable micr obes in the samples, the relativ ely tiny number of micr obes would also suggest an unusually harsh envir onment, then Fier er\u2019s team and the author of Text 2 would most lik ely agr ee that most micr obes ar e unable t o withstand the soil conditions at the Antar ctic study site. Choice A is incorr ect. The samples tak en b y Fier er\u2019s team wer e from an ar ea of Antar ctica that is described in par t as extr emely dry, and these samples didn \u2019t appear t o ha ve any lif e.

The author of Text 2 does state that micr obes ar e found in vir tually e very envir onment on Ear th and suggests that new technology ma y be better able t o detect so f ew micr obes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of micr obes in the Antar ctic samples is e vidence of the harsh Antar ctic envir onment.

    "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined lines in the text as a whole. In the opening line of the text, the speak er describes wandering in \" alien lands, \" which establishes that the speak er is tr aveling in unfamiliar territ ory. In the underlined lines, the speak er describes \"billows\" (lar ge wa ves) r olling in the soul, which suggests that the speak er feels inner turmoil. The underlined lines go on t o associate these r olling billows with v oices calling t o the speak er from the speak er\u2019s \"nativ e str ands, \" or homeland, indicating that thoughts of home ar e prompting the emotional experience these lines describe. Taken together , the imager y in the underlined lines thus implies that the speak er feels a deep emotional connection t o, or pull t owar d, home while tr aveling in an unfamiliar place. Choice A is incorr ect. While the text\u2019 s \ufb01rst line states that the speak er is tr aveling and the underlined lines indicate that the speak er experiences an emotional pull t owar d home, neither the underlined lines nor the text as a whole establishes an enthusiasm about the curr ent tr avels that con\ufb02icts with a gr owing ur ge to return home. The text\u2019 s description of the lands the speak er is tr aveling in focuses on their ar ti\ufb01cial quality , stating, \"Natur e her pr erogativ e resigns / To Man, \" which doesn \u2019t suggest enthusiasm but r ather a sense of detachment or e ven critique. Choice B is incorr ect because the underlined lines don \u2019t addr ess uncer tainty about maintaining links with r elativ es in distant places. In the underlined lines, the speak er expr esses a sense of connection t o the speak er\u2019s homeland (\" nativ e str ands\") but doesn \u2019t refer to any family members the speak er ma y have ther e or t o concerns about maintaining any familial ties. Choice D is incorr ect because the poem doesn \u2019t indicate that the speak er has r eturned home after an absence. Rather , the speak er explicitly states, \"I wander among the hills of alien lands, \" establishing that the curr ent setting is a foreign place.

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined por tion in the text. The underlined portion (\" which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for \") dir ectly expr esses Gr ande \u2019s unhappiness about her sister \u2019s diminished inter est in her Barbie doll. The underlined text speci\ufb01cally identi\ufb01es that Gr ande f eels sad and explains why Mago \u2019s disinter est par ticularly aff ects her\u2014because it was the one r are instance wher e her older sister had envied her, rather than the r everse. Choice B is incorr ect because the underlined por tion expr esses sadness, not anger .

Choice C is incorr ect. While the \ufb01rst par t of the sentence that contains the underlined por tion indicates that Mago has pr eviously taken an inter est in Gr ande \u2019s Barbie, implying that the sisters ma y regularly ha ve pla yed with the Barbie t ogether in the past, the underlined por tion doesn \u2019t provide an example of this. The underlined por tion instead explains why Mago \u2019s recently de veloped disinter est in the Barbie saddens Gr ande. Choice D is incorr ect because neither the underlined por tion nor the text as a whole explains why Mago is unwilling t o pla y with Gr ande. Rather than addr essing Mago \u2019s motiv ation or r easoning, the underlined por tion describes Gr ande \u2019s emotional r eaction t o Mago \u2019s disinter est in Gr ande \u2019s Barbie and explains why this lack of inter est matters t o Grande.",
