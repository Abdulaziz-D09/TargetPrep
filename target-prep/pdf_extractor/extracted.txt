Marta Coll and colleagues’ 2010 Mediterr anean Sea biodiv ersity census r epor ted appr oximately 17,000 species, nearly double the
number r epor ted in Carlo Bianchi and Carla Morri’ s 2000 census—a diff erence only par tly attributable t o the description of new
invertebrate species in the interim. Another fact or is that the morphological v ariability of micr oorganisms is poorly underst ood
compar ed to that of v ertebrates, inv ertebrates, plants, and algae, cr eating uncer tainty about how t o evaluate micr oorganisms as

Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. Coll and colleagues r epor ted a much higher number of species than Bianchi and Morri did lar gely due t o the inclusion of

ID: f1bfbed3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the diff erent
counts of species in the Mediterr anean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues r epor ted almost double the number of
species that Bianchi and Morri r epor ted in their study ten y ears earlier . Accor ding t o the text, this diff erence can only be par tly
attributed t o new inv ertebrate species being described in the y ears between the two studies, which means ther e must be an
additional fact or that made Coll and colleagues’ count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri’ s count. The text goes on t o explain
that fact or: resear chers ha ve a r elativ ely poor understanding of micr oorganisms’ morphological v ariability , or the diff erences in
micr oorganisms’ structur e and form. This poor understanding mak es it har d to classify micr oorganisms b y species and means
that r esear chers’ decisions about classifying micr oorganisms can ha ve a lar ge eff ect on the o verall species counts that
resear chers r epor t. Additionally , the text sa ys that the two censuses r epor ted similar numbers of v ertebrate, plant, and algal
species, which means that the diff erence in o verall species did not come fr om diff erences in those categories. Giv en all this
information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues ma y have treated some of the diff erences among micr oorganisms
as indicativ e of the micr oorganisms being diff erent species, wher eas Bianchi and Morri tr eated those diff erences as v ariations
within species, r esulting in Coll and colleagues r epor ting many mor e species than Bianchi and Morri did.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text explicitly addr esses this issue b y stating that the description of new inv ertebrate species in
the y ears between the two studies can explain only par t of the diff erence in the number of species r epor ted b y the studies. The
focus of the text is on explaining the diff erence between Coll and colleagues’ count and Bianchi and Morri’ s count that cannot be
accounted for b y the inclusion of inv ertebrate species that had not been described at the time of Bianchi and Morri’ s study . Choice
C is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri ma y have been less sensitiv e to how much the form and
structur e of micr oorganisms v ary within the same species than Coll and colleagues wer e. If Bianchi and Morri had been less
sensitiv e to within-species v ariation than Coll and colleagues wer e, Bianchi and Morri would lik ely ha ve repor ted mor e speciesAssessment

than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity t o within-species v ariation would lead r esear chers t o classify as diff erent
species micr oorganisms that mor e sensitiv e resear chers would classify as v ariations within the same species. The text indicates,
howe ver, that Bianchi and Morri r epor ted far f ewer species than Coll and colleagues did; since the text also ex cludes other
explanations for this diff erence, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and Morri wer e mor e sensitiv e to within-species v ariation than Coll
and colleagues wer e, leading Bianchi and Morri t o repor t fewer o verall species. Choice D is incorr ect because the text is focused
on explaining why Coll and colleagues r epor ted many mor e species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an under estimate of the
number of micr oorganism species b y Coll and colleagues would not explain that diff erence—it would suggest, in fact, that the
difference in the number of species should ha ve been e ven lar ger.

A common assumption among ar t hist orians is that the inv ention of phot ography in the mid-nineteenth centur y displaced the
painted por trait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the por trait miniatur e, which coincided with the rise of
phot ography , seems t o suppor t this claim. Howe ver, phot ography ’s impact on the por trait miniatur e ma y be o verstated. Although
recor ds fr om ar t exhibitions in the Netherlands fr om 1820 t o 1892 show a decr ease in the number of both full-siz ed and miniatur e
portraits submitted, this tr end was established befor e the inv ention of phot ography .
Based on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the por trait miniatur e in the nineteenth centur y?  
A. Factors other than the rise of phot ography ma y be mor e dir ectly r esponsible for the por trait miniatur e’s decline.
B. Although por trait miniatur es became less common than phot ographs, the y wer e widely r egar ded as ha ving mor e artistic merit.
    
C. The popularity of the por trait miniatur e likely persisted for longer than ar t hist orians ha ve assumed. 
D. As demand for por trait miniatur es decr eased, por trait ar tists lik ely shifted their cr eativ e focus t o phot ography . 
ID: 87aa7bab  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The text sa ys that the impact of phot ography on the por trait miniatur e might be " overstated, " as some
recor ds show a decr ease in the number of por trait miniatur es befor e the inv ention of phot ography . From this, we can conclude that
factors other  than the rise of phot ography ma y be mor e dir ectly r esponsible for the por trait miniatur e’s decline.
Choice B is incorr ect. The text ne ver discusses the " artistic merit" of either ar t form. Choice C is incorr ect. The text ne ver suggests
that the por trait miniatur e was popular for longer than hist orians thought—if anything, it suggests that the por trait miniatur e
started losing its popularity earlier  than hist orians thought. Choice D is incorr ect. The text ne ver suggests that por trait painters

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. Accor ding t o the text, conceptual ar tists
Gins and Ar akawa ha ve designed an apar tment building that is disorienting because of se veral unconv entional elements, such as
uneven kitchen counters and “ a door t o nowher e.” The text goes on t o suggest that ther e ma y be beneﬁts t o this kind of design
because ﬁlmmak er Yamaoka liv ed in the apar tment building for four y ears and r epor ted health beneﬁts. Thus, although the design
is impr actical, it ma y impr ove the well-being of the apar tment building’ s residents. 
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text mentions that Y amaoka liv ed in the apar tment for four y ears, it doesn ’t addr ess how long
someone can beneﬁcially liv e in a home surr ounded b y fanciful f eatur es or whether doing so can be sustained. Choice B is
incorr ect. Although the text mentions the potential beneﬁts of living in a home with disorienting design f eatur es, it doesn ’t suggest
that this is the most eff ectiv e method t o create a physically stimulating envir onment. Choice C is incorr ect because the text r efers

ID: d748c3f d Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . Johnson collected “ ephemer a,” or things that ar e meant t o be thr own awa y. Scholars thought his
collection was wor thless t o them, then later r ealiz ed that it was potentially v aluable. This suggests that scholars went fr om
disregar ding ephemer a to recognizing their usefulness.
Choice A is incorr ect. This inf erence isn ’t suppor ted. The text tells us that the Bodleian Libr ary acquir ed Johnson ’s lar ge collection
of ephemer a back in 1968, so we can assume that contempor ary hist orians conducting r esear ch ther e do ha ve access t o that

One r ecogniz ed social norm of gift giving is that the time spent obtaining a gift will be viewed as a r eﬂection of the gift’ s

will appr eciate them less than the y do physical gift car ds.
ID: 6b8a7c74  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of per ceptions of digital v ersus physical gift
cards. The text begins b y explaining that the per ception of "the time spent obtaining a gift…as a r eﬂection of the gift’ s
thoughtfulness" is a social norm of gift giving. The text then explains that although those who r eceiv e digital gift car ds view them
as easier t o use than physical gift car ds, a mark eting study nonetheless showed that 94.8% of par ticipants found physical gift
cards mor e "socially acceptable " to giv e. The text speciﬁcally contr asts the ease with which digital gift car ds "can be pur chased
online fr om anywher e" with the fact that physical gift car ds "sometimes must be pur chased in person "—suggesting the gr eater
diﬃculty of obtaining physical car ds. Giv en the text’ s initial pr emise that gift-giving norms equate the thoughtfulness of a gift with
the effor t involved in acquiring that gift, it is r easonable t o inf er that people per ceive digital gift car ds as r equiring less effor t to
obtain and thus assume r ecipients will appr eciate them less, e ven though r ecipients actually pr efer gift car ds in the mor e usable
digital format.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text does discuss r ecipients’ pr eference of digital v ersus physical gift car ds and the r elativ e
ease with which the two formats can be used, it doesn ’t consider the misconceptions that gift giv ers ma y have of these fact ors.
Moreover, the text establishes that r ecipients r egar d digital gift car ds as easier t o use and ther efore preferable t o physical gift
cards. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t consider whether r ecipients of gift car ds feel a sense of ownership t owar d
them, nor does the text t ouch on the gr eater tangibility of physical v ersus digital gift car ds. Instead, the text contr asts the two
formats of gift car ds in terms of their r espectiv e usability and the diﬃculty inv olved in acquiring them and discusses how those
factors inﬂuence people ’s per ceptions of the two formats. Choice C is incorr ect because it contr adicts the text, which explains that
recipients r egar d digital gift car ds as superior t o physical ones because the y are easier t o use than physical car ds, not because
physical gift car ds requir e greater effor t to obtain than digital gift car ds do. Mor eover, the text doesn ’t char acteriz e the effor t
requir ed to obtain physical gift car ds as "unnecessar y."Assessment

To understand how temper ature change aff ects micr oorganism-mediated cy cling of soil nutrients in alpine ecosystems, E va
Kašt ovská et al. collected plant-soil cor es in the Tatra Mountains at ele vations ar ound 2,100 meters and tr ansplanted them t o
elevations of 1,700–1,800 meters, wher e the mean air temper ature was warmer b y 2°C. Micr oorganism-mediated nutrient cy cling
was acceler ated in the tr ansplanted cor es; crucially , micr oorganism community composition was unchanged, allowing Kašt ovská
et al. t o attribute the acceler ation t o temper ature-induced incr eases in micr oorganism activity . 
It can most r easonably be inf erred fr om the text that the ﬁnding about the micr oorganism community composition was impor tant
for which r eason?
A. It provided pr eliminar y evidence that micr oorganism-mediated nutrient cy cling was acceler ated in the tr ansplanted cor es. 
B. It suggested that temper ature-induced changes in micr oorganism activity ma y be occurring at incr easingly high ele vations. 
C. It ruled out a potential alternativ e explanation for the acceler ation in micr oorganism-mediated nutrient cy cling. 
D. It clariﬁed that micr oorganism activity le vels in the plant-soil cor es varied depending on which micr oorganisms comprised the
community . 
ID: 458b4a11  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it accur ately describes why the ﬁnding about the micr oorganism community composition
was impor tant. The text describes an experiment b y Eva Kašt ovská and her team in which the y collected plant-soil cor es at one
elevation and tr ansplanted them t o sites at a lower ele vation, wher e the mean air temper ature was warmer . Kašt ovská and her
team obser ved that micr oorganism-mediated nutrient cy cling was acceler ated in the tr ansplanted cor es and that " crucially ,
micr oorganism community composition was unchanged, " which allowed the team t o attribute the acceler ation t o changes in
micr oorganism activity br ought about b y the diff erence in temper ature. This str ongly implies that the team wouldn ’t ha ve been
able t o mak e that attribution other wise, meaning that a change in micr oorganism composition r epresented another possible
explanation for the acceler ation that had t o be ruled out.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text sa ys micr oorganism-mediated cy cling of soil nutrients incr eased in the tr ansplanted cor es,
this is unr elated t o what’ s impor tant about the ﬁnding that the micr oorganism composition didn ’t change—that it allowed the team
to attribute the change in activity solely t o the change in temper ature. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text compar es activity in
one cor e at two diff erent ele vations, the text doesn ’t addr ess changes in activity at v arious ele vations o ver time. Choice D is
incorr ect. Although diff erent micr oorganisms lik ely exhibit diff erent le vels of activity , the text indicates that ther e was no change in
micr oorganism composition, and ther e is nothing in the text about diff erent micr oorganisms ha ving diff erent activity le vels.

Jean-Bernar d Car on and colleagues r ecently disco vered a cache of jellyﬁsh fossils in the Bur gess Shale, a site in the Canadian

Which statement, if true, would most dir ectly weak en the claim b y Car on and colleagues about the fossils found in China and the

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a statement that, if true, would most dir ectly weak en Car on and colleagues’ claim
that the appar ent tentacles in the Chinese and American fossils ar e actually ctenophor e comb r ows. If the fossils ar e so poorly
preser ved that the y cannot be conclusiv ely identiﬁed as either or ganism, neither the claim that the y are jellyﬁsh nor , as Car on
claims, that the y are ctenophor es would be suppor ted.
Choice A is incorr ect. Car on’s claim is that fossils fr om the US and China ar e ctenophor es, not jellyﬁsh. These fossils ar e said t o be
"of a similar age " to the Cambrian fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. And nothing in the text or this choice suggests that the
presence or absence of ctenophor es after the Cambrian would ha ve any bearing on whether the Cambrian fossils fr om the US and
China ar e ctenophor es. Choice C is incorr ect. Car on’s claim is that fossils fr om the US and China ar e ctenophor es, not jellyﬁsh.
Nothing in the text suggests that the pr esence or absence of ctenophor es in the Bur gess Shale (in Canada) would aff ect whether
the fossils found in the US and China ar e ctenophor es. Choice D is incorr ect. Car on’s claim is that fossils fr om the US and China

Choice D is the best answer because it pr ovides a detail about Elinor that is established in the text. The text indicates that
although Elinor is “ only nineteen, ” she giv es good advice and exhibits such a high le vel of understanding and judgment that she
serves as “the counsellor of her mother .” Thus, Elinor is matur e be yond her y ears.   
Choice A is incorr ect because it isn ’t suppor ted b y the text: although the text sa ys that Elinor advises her mother and often
counter acts her mother ’s impulses, ther e’s no mention of Elinor ar guing with her mother or failing t o change her mother ’s mind.
Choice B is incorr ect because it isn ’t suppor ted b y the text: although the text mentions that Elinor has str ong f eelings, it doesn ’t
indicate that she ’s excessiv ely sensitiv e when it comes t o family issues. Choice C is incorr ect because it isn ’t suppor ted b y the
text: ther e’s no mention of what Elinor thinks about her mother and no suggestion that she thinks her mother is a bad r ole model.
Because she ’s described as ha ving “ an ex cellent hear t,” Elinor lik ely doesn ’t think ill of her mother .

Many liter ary theorists distinguish between fabula , a narr ative’s content, and syuzhet , a narr ative’s arr angement and pr esentation of

story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958. But liter ary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin maintained that fabula and

Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text begins b y explaining that many

discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a liter ary theorist, ar gued that fabula  and syuzhet  can’t fully describe a narr ative, since systematic
categorizations such as these fail t o account for all the wa ys in which inter actions between the ar tist, the work, and the audience

Choice B is incorr ect because accor ding t o the text, Mikhail Bakhtin belie ved that meaning was cr eated thr ough the inter actions of

The ancient Gr eek concept of “ mimesis, ” a term used in the works of Plat o, Arist otle, and other Gr eek philosophers in discussions
of representational ar t—visual, per formance, or liter ary art that aims t o depict the r eal world—is a foundational concept of the
Western philosophy of aesthetics. Mimesis is typically tr anslated as “imitation ” in modern editions of ancient Gr eek texts, but
scholar Stephen Halliwell warns that this is o verly r eductiv e: “imitation ” implies that ar t mer ely copies—and is thus b y deﬁnition
entir ely deriv ative of—a r eality that exists outside and prior t o the work of ar t, and tr anslating “ mimesis” thusly obscur es the
multifaceted wa ys in which the ancient Gr eeks underst ood the r elationship between ar t and r eality .
Which statement, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the claim b y Halliwell pr esented in the text?
A. One of the earliest appear ances of mimesis’ s root wor d, mimos , can be found in an ancient Gr eek tr agedy in r eference t o
dramatic impersonation, and the mim-  root came t o be gener ally associated with the musical and poetic ar ts by the ﬁfth
centur y BCE.
B. Both Plat o’s and Arist otle’s theorizations of mimesis examine the psy chological eff ects that works of ar t induce in the viewer
or listener .
C. Although se veral of Plat o’s earliest philosophical works discuss aesthetic ideas, the term “ mimesis” doesn ’t appear in Plat o’s
discussions of ar t until Cratylus , a relativ ely late work.
D. Although Plat o’s writings typically char acteriz e representational ar t as an inf erior r eﬂection of the physical world, Arist otle
suggests that mimesis can r efer to art’s capacity t o envision hypothetical conditions that could, but don ’t yet, exist.

Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a statement that would suppor t Halliwell’ s claim that "imitation " is an o verly
simpliﬁed tr anslation of the wor d "mimesis" in the context of ancient Gr eek philosophical discussions of r epresentational ar t and
that, because it suggests a view of ar t as mer ely cop ying things that exist in r eality , the tr anslation obscur es the fact that Plat o,
Arist otle, and other ancient Gr eeks underst ood the r elationship between ar t and r eality in v aried wa ys. If Plat o’s works tend t o treat
representational ar t as an inf erior or inadequate r eﬂection of the physical world (consistent with the idea of mer e imitation), while
Arist otle’s works suggest that the term " mimesis" can r efer to art’s ability t o show conditions that don ’t curr ently exist but could
exist (going be yond imitation int o no vel cr eation), that e vidence would suppor t the claim that the term " mimesis" means mor e than
just "imitation " and that ancient Gr eek philosophers held diff erent views of the r elationship between ar t and r eality .
Choice A is incorr ect because information about the r oot wor d mimos  ﬁrst being used in dr ama and the r oot mim - coming t o be
associated with music and poetr y wouldn ’t indicate anything about the meaning of the speciﬁc term " mimesis" as it was used b y
ancient Gr eek philosophers in discussions of r epresentational ar t; thus, the information would ha ve no bearing on Halliwell’ s claim
that a common tr anslation of the speciﬁc term is an o versimpliﬁcation. Choice B is incorr ect because the issue of ar t’s
psychological eff ects on audiences gets at how people r espond t o works of ar t instead of how ar t itself is r elated t o reality , so the
idea that Plat o and Arist otle both addr essed such eff ects in their consider ations of mimesis wouldn ’t ha ve any bearing on
Halliwell’ s claim that a common tr anslation of that term o versimpliﬁes the r elationship between ar t and r eality . Further, this idea

aesthetics in his early works but didn ’t use the term " mimesis" until later doesn ’t giv e any indication of how Plat o or any other

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the potential eff ects of logging on for est

these r esults, it follows that logging ma y be a useful pr actice for maintaining healthy for ests if it is pr acticed in a limited wa y.
Choice B is incorr ect because the study r eferenced in the text only pr ovides information on limited logging as a potential for est

Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the r esear chers’ conclusion that
an obser vable pattern in time r eferences in no vels r eﬂects a shift in human beha vior pr ompted b y the spr ead of electric lighting in
the late nineteenth centur y. If no vels published after 1880 contain signiﬁcantly mor e references t o activities occurring after 10
p.m. than no vels fr om earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human beha vior and daily r outines enabled b y the
availability of electric lighting. Befor e electric lighting—which pr ovided illumination mor e easily than other a vailable forms of light—
many activities ceased after nightfall, so r eferences t o late-night activities would be less common in earlier no vels. An incr ease in
such r eferences after 1880 would align with the r esear chers’ conclusion, r eﬂecting an incr ease in late-night activities made

Choice A is incorr ect because a decr ease in r eferences t o 10 a.m. after the y ear 1800 would not suppor t the r esear chers’
conclusion inv olving a shift in human beha vior pr ompted b y the spr ead of electric lighting t owar d the end of the 1800s. The time
of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, char acteriz ed b y daylight, so a change in r eferences t o that time would not be
clearly link ed to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorr ect because while an incr ease in implied time r eferences r elativ e
to clock phr ases in nineteenth-centur y novels could suggest a change in writing style or conv entions, it does not dir ectly suppor t
the conclusion inv olving a shift in human beha vior pr ompted b y the spr ead of electric lighting. The text indicates that the

Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that New added unique, handcr afted details t o his bags befor e he star ted using

Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the ar ts journalist’ s claim about
Enwez or’s work as a cur ator and ar t hist orian. In the text, the ar ts journalist asser ts that Enwez or wished not just t o focus on

their work r elates t o artistic de velopments and work b y other ar tists elsewher e in the world. The description of Postwar: Ar t

together with works b y artists fr om other countries, thus suppor ting the ar ts journalist’ s claim that Enwez or sought t o show works
by African ar tists in a context of global modern ar t and ar t hist ory.
Choice A is incorr ect because it describes a r etrospectiv e that wouldn ’t suppor t the ar ts journalist’ s claim that Enwez or wanted t o
show how works b y modern African ar tists ﬁt int o the lar ger context of global modern ar t and ar t hist ory. The description of El

Resear chers Bernal and de Silv a wer e curious if the mating calls wer e suﬃcient signals for the midges t o locate the fr ogs or if

Choice A is incorr ect because ﬁnding that the majority of fr og-biting midges wer e found in the tr aps that both pla yed the mating

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely illustr ates the claim that Lowell describes an element of natur e as an
activ e par ticipant in the experience of a nighttime scene on a body of water . The quotation pr esents the image of the moon
shining on a body of water . Howe ver, instead of describing the moon in passiv e terms or simply stating that it r eﬂects thr ough the
water and ont o the sandy shor e, the quotation por trays the moon as being engaged in the humanlik e action of writing a legend. In
other wor ds, the moon is par ticipating activ ely in the nighttime scene.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the quotation describes a nighttime scene on a body of water , the element of natur e in these lines
—the wa ves—isn ’t por trayed as an activ e par ticipant in an experience; instead, the wa ves mer ely ripple softly against a canoe, as
waves would normally do. Choice C is incorr ect because the quotation doesn ’t present a nighttime scene on a body of water;
instead, it describes petals falling fr om a r ose. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the quotation pr esents an image of an element of
natur e—the moon—it doesn ’t mention a body of water; mor eover, it por trays the moon not as an activ e par ticipant in a scene but

surveyed Lima r esidents r epor ted using their city ’s parks. The text then notes that compar ed to Lima r espondents, a much smaller
percentage of Quit o respondents said the y live within a 10-minute walk of a park. The text concludes that because a gr eater
propor tion of Quit o respondents used parks despite gener ally living far ther fr om them than Lima r espondents did, " greater
proximity "—being closer t o a park—" can’t explain the diff erence in park use. " That is, the text mak es the point that the diff erence
between the pr opor tions of Quit o residents and Lima r esidents using parks is caused b y something other than the distance of the
parks fr om city r esidents.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess whether the r esear chers had expected a par ticular r esult and doesn ’t
indicate that the y wer e surprised b y the diff erence in park usage between the two cities’ r esidents. The text simply pr esents the
survey ﬁndings without stating the r esear chers’ expectations. Choice C is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that ther e
might be inaccur acies in the sur vey results; the text pr esents the ﬁndings as factual information and uses them as the basis for a
conclusion that a cer tain fact or doesn ’t explain diff erences in park usage between Quit o and Lima r esidents. Choice D is incorr ect
because the text doesn ’t mention any sour ces that pr edate the sur vey or suggest that the diff erence in pr opor tions was calculated
using such sour ces. Accor ding t o the text, the information about park usage came dir ectly fr om the sur vey of r esidents in Quit o

ID: 57485f5e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely states the main idea of the text, which is that Heidi is delighted and
fascinated b y an image she sees in one of Gr andmama ’s books. In the text, Heidi scr eams upon ﬁrst seeing the pictur e of the
green pastur e. In another context, such a r eaction might suggest f ear, but her e the r eaction is followed b y descriptions of an image
that’ s peaceful r ather than scar y. The text goes on t o describe Heidi’ s eyes as “ glowing” and states that she “ devoured the scene, ”
suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants t o examine e very detail. Together , these
descriptions suggest that Heidi is thrilled and intrigued b y the image in the book.
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that Heidi is upset befor e seeing the peaceful image of the
green pastur e. Befor e Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as “looking with wondering e yes at the splendid pictur es” in the
book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she ’s unhapp y. Choice C is incorr ect. Although Heidi scr eams upon ﬁrst seeing
the image, the text’ s description of the image and Heidi’ s other r eactions t o it suggest that she is scr eaming with delight, not f ear.
The text describes the images in the book as “ splendid” and the par ticular image that causes her t o scr eam as peaceful r ather
than frightening. It also describes Heidi’ s eyes as “ glowing” and states that she “ devoured the scene, ” suggesting that the image of
the gr een pastur e delights and fascinates her so much that she wants t o examine e very detail. Choice D is incorr ect because it’ s
unclear fr om the text whether Heidi has e ver seen a shepher d with his sheep befor e. The text mer ely suggests that she is

ID: a68f d3e7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the r elativ e appeal of diff erent kinds of
plays by Shak espear e to today’s audiences. Accor ding t o the text, Shak espear e’s tragedies addr ess br oad themes that continue t o
appeal t o today’s audiences. Indeed, the text suggests that these themes ar e timeless, as illustr ated b y the example of Romeo and
Juliet , which the text states is still r ead and widely per formed despite being set in the Italy of Shak espear e’s time. In contr ast, the
text indicates that audiences and r eaders ma y need t o be familiar with se veral centuries of English hist ory in or der t o understand
Shak espear e’s hist ory pla ys. Because many theater goers and r eaders ar e unlik ely to possess such extensiv e hist orical knowledge,
it follows that the y are likely to ﬁnd Shak espear e’s hist ory pla ys less engaging than his mor e accessible tr agedies.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text ne ver intr oduces a comparison between Shak espear e’s tragedies and twentieth-centur y
plays, only between Shak espear e’s tragedies and his hist ory pla ys. Since twentieth-centur y pla ys ar en’t mentioned, ther e’s no basis
in the text for the idea that some of Shak espear e’s tragedies ar e mor e relevant than twentieth-centur y pla ys to today’s audiences.
Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that Romeo and Juliet is thematically accessible t o today’s audiences, it doesn ’t
suggest that Romeo and Juliet  is mor e accessible than Shak espear e’s other tr agedies. Rather , the text pr esents Romeo and Juliet
as an example t o suppor t the idea that Shak espear e’s tragedies hold continued appeal for t oday’s readers and theater goers.
Choice D is incorr ect. Although exper ts in English hist ory would lik ely possess the knowledge needed t o understand
Shak espear e’s hist ory pla ys, the text ne ver mentions such exper ts or suggests that the y would enjo y the hist ory pla ys mor e than

ID: bc7b1a04  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it uses data fr om the table t o giv e the r ange of v elocities for the LMC fr om the 1980 v alue
(344 km/s) t o the 2006 v alue (378 km/s), ther eby eff ectiv ely completing the text. The text indicates that befor e 2006, all the
estimated v elocities of the LMC wer e within the r ange necessar y to maintain orbit ar ound the Milky W ay galaxy . It then indicates
that, accor ding t o Besla and colleagues, the 2006 estimate of 378 km/s is t oo high t o maintain that orbit. This str ongly implies that
if the 1980 v alue (344 km/s) is below the orbital thr eshold, and if Besla and colleagues ar e corr ect that the 2006 v alue (378 km/s)
is abo ve that thr eshold, the maximum orbital v elocity for the LMC must be somewher e in the r ange fr om abo ve 344 km/s t o below
378 km/s.
Choice B is incorr ect. The text indicates that the 2006 v elocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the ﬁrst estimate that
exceeded the v elocity needed t o maintain orbit ar ound the Milky W ay. Thus, the 1980 estimate of 344 km/s and the 1994 estimate
of 297 km/s must both be below the maximum possible orbital v elocity for the LMC. Choice C is incorr ect. The text states that
Besla and colleagues’ analysis found that the v elocity fr om the 2006 study (378 km/s) was t oo high for the LMC t o maintain orbit
around the Milky W ay. Ther efore, if a v elocity of 378 km/s is t oo high, an e ven higher v elocity will also be t oo high. Choice D is
incorr ect. The text indicates that the 2006 v elocity estimate for the LMC (378 km/s) was the ﬁrst t o exceed the v elocity r ange
requir ed to maintain orbit ar ound the Milky W ay. Thus, the 1994 estimate of 297 km/s must be below the maximum possible

ID: 3d91c973  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents the ﬁnding that, if true, would best suppor t Suar ez, P érez-Huer ta, and Harr ell’s
claim about mosasaurs. The text states that Suar ez, P érez-Huer ta, and Harr ell’s resear ch on mosasaur t ooth enamel led them t o
conclude that mosasaurs wer e endothermic, which means that the y could liv e in waters at many diff erent temper atures and still
maintain a stable body temper ature. The r esear chers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs t o live in r elativ ely cold waters
near the poles. If se veral mosasaur fossils ha ve been found in ar eas that wer e near the poles during the period when mosasaurs
were aliv e and fossils of nonendothermic marine r eptiles ar e rare in such locations, that would suppor t the r esear chers’ claim: it
would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not t o, suggesting that
endothermy ma y have been the char acteristic that enabled mosasaurs t o include polar waters in their r ange.
Choice A is incorr ect because ﬁnding that it’ s easier t o determine mosasaur body temper atures fr om t ooth enamel data than it is
to determine nonendothermic r eptile body temper atures wouldn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ claim. Whether one r esear ch pr ocess is
more diﬃcult than another indicates nothing about the r esults of those pr ocesses and ther efore is irr elevant t o the issue of wher e
mosasaurs liv ed and what enabled them t o live in those locations.   Choice B is incorr ect because ﬁnding r oughly equal numbers
of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine r eptile fossils in ar eas that wer e near the poles in the Late Cr etaceous would suggest
that endothermy didn ’t giv e mosasaurs any par ticular adv antage when it came t o expanding their r ange t o include r elativ ely cold
polar waters, ther eby weak ening the r esear chers’ claim r ather than suppor ting it. Choice D is incorr ect because ﬁnding that the
temper ature of seawater in the Late Cr etaceous was warmer than seawater t oday wouldn ’t weak en the r esear chers’ claim.
Seawater in the Late Cr etaceous could ha ve been warmer than seawater t oday but still cold enough for endothermy t o be
advantageous t o mosasaurs, so this ﬁnding wouldn ’t provide enough information t o either suppor t or weak en the r esear chers’

A contr action of “y ou all, ” the pr onoun “y ’all” has long been used as a plur al version of “y ou” in the South and in Black communities

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a question that the text is attempting t o answer: why has the pr onoun "y ’all"
become mor e widely used in the US? The text begins b y explaining wher e and how the plur al pr onoun "y ’all" originated and then
goes on t o state that its use has been rising in popularity , even in ar eas outside of its place of origin. The text then attributes this
rise in popularity t o the fact that many v arieties of English do not ha ve a pr onoun t o addr ess mor e than one person, and thus "y ou"
must function as both a singular and plur al pr onoun.
Choice A is incorr ect because while the text states that "y ’all" is used as a plur al of "y ou" in English, it does not discuss other plur al
forms of the wor d. Choice C is incorr ect because while the text discusses the gener al origins of the pr onoun "y ’all," it does not

ID: 4b3d6062  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of conser vation appr oaches for the
Mammillaria cactus M. boolii . The text establishes that M. boolii  only gr ows natur ally in the state of Sonor a in Mexico, which
mak es it par ticularly vulner able t o extinction. The text then contr asts two appr oaches t o conser vation: the tr aditional single-
species appr oach that individually focuses on at-risk species and a newer ecosystem-based appr oach that considers the
inter actions between climate, terr ain, and v arious species in a geogr aphical ar ea. Accor ding t o the text, conser vationists ha ve
recently ar gued that this ecosystem-based appr oach ma y lead t o better outcomes for all species in a location. If this ecosystem
view is corr ect, then the single-species appr oach t o conser ving M. boolii  would lik ely fail t o consider how the cactus’ s sur vival
depends on its inter actions with other species in Sonor a’s ecosystem.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess the distribution of Mammillaria species besides M. boolii  throughout
Mexico or discuss how that distribution aff ects sur vival. The text focuses speciﬁcally on M. boolii  in Sonor a and diff erent
appr oaches t o its conser vation. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that climatic changes in Sonor a would
reduce competition for M. boolii  or that conser vation effor ts ar e focused on understanding this speciﬁc dynamic. In fact, the text
implies that an ecosystem-based appr oach would consider climate among many other fact ors but doesn ’t specify how climatic
changes might aff ect competition between species. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that the single-species
appr oach would shift the focus of conser vation effor ts awa y from M. boolii  itself—r ather , it suggests that this appr oach might be
too narr owly focused on M. boolii  alone without considering the br oader ecosystem-r elated fact ors that aff ect its sur vival.

ID: 94ca8ebd  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it would most dir ectly suppor t the student’ s claim about the motiv ation for including
explanat ory notes with the stand-alone v olume of the poem. The text explains that the poem had pr eviously been published
without the notes in a quar terly journal. It stands t o reason that r eaders who had pur chased the journal issue containing the poem
would be unlik ely to pur chase an unchanged v ersion of the poem in a stand-alone v olume. Howe ver, the inclusion of notes in that
volume would encour age the pur chase of a stand-alone v olume, since the later text would diff er from the original b y including the
author ’s own explanation of the poem. Ther efore, if it wer e true that the publishers of the stand-alone v olume had r equested the
notes t o mak e the book attr activ e to readers who alr eady had a cop y of the journal issue, this fact would suppor t the student’ s
claim that the notes wer e included primarily as a mark eting de vice.
Choice A is incorr ect because the student’ s claim is about the motiv ation for including the explanat ory notes in the stand-alone
volume, not about changes that might ha ve been made t o the poem itself for publication in that v olume; mor eover, the text ne ver

In 1934 physicist E ugene Wigner posited the existence of a cr ystal consisting entir ely of electr ons in a hone ycomb-lik e structur e.
The so-called Wigner cr ystal r emained lar gely conjectur e, howe ver, until F eng W ang and colleagues announced in 2021 that the y
had captur ed an image of one. The r esear chers tr apped electr ons between two semiconduct ors and then cooled the appar atus,
causing the electr ons t o settle int o a cr ystalline structur e. By inser ting an ultr athin sheet of gr aphene abo ve the cr ystal, the
resear chers obtained an impr ession—the ﬁrst visual conﬁrmation of the Wigner cr ystal.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Resear chers ha ve obtained the most deﬁnitiv e evidence t o date of the existence of the Wigner cr ystal.
B. Resear chers ha ve identiﬁed an inno vative new method for working with unusual cr ystalline structur es.
C. Graphene is the most impor tant of the components r equir ed to captur e an image of a Wigner cr ystal.
D.  It’s diﬃcult t o acquir e an image of a Wigner cr ystal because of the cr ystal’ s hone ycomb structur e.
ID: 66c47028  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. Accor ding t o the text, E ugene Wigner
hypothesiz ed that a cr ystal could exist that would be composed of electr ons and ha ve a hone ycomb-lik e shape. The text goes on
to sa y that the existence of the Wigner cr ystal r emained unconﬁrmed until F eng W ang and colleagues wer e able t o mak e an
impr ession of one using two semiconduct ors and an ultr athin sheet of gr aphene. Thus, the main idea is that r esear chers ha ve
obtained the most deﬁnitiv e evidence t o date of the existence of the Wigner cr ystal.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text focuses on one kind of cr ystal—the Wigner cr ystal— and doesn ’t discuss cr ystalline
structur es in gener al. And although the text conv eys that W ang and colleagues ﬁgur ed out a wa y to captur e an image of a Wigner
crystal, it doesn ’t addr ess the idea of applying this appr oach t o other types of cr ystals. Choice C is incorr ect because the text
describes in gener al the pr ocess W ang and colleagues followed t o obtain an impr ession of the Wigner cr ystal; it doesn ’t addr ess
the r elativ e impor tance of each component in that pr ocess. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t state that r esear chers
had a har d time getting an impr ession of the Wigner cr ystal because of its hone ycomb structur e. Nothing in the text indicates why
it took so long t o prove the existence of this cr ystal or tak e an impr ession of it.

Which quotation fr om O Pioneers!  most eff ectiv ely illustr ates the claim?
A. “She had ne ver known befor e how much the countr y meant t o her . The chirping of the insects down in the long gr ass had been

ID: 0770b53d  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the quotation that most dir ectly illustr ates the claim that Cather por trays
Alexandr a as ha ving a deep emotional connection t o her natur al surr oundings. This quotation states that the countr y meant a
great deal t o Alexandr a and then goes on t o detail se veral wa ys in which her natur al surr oundings aff ect her emotionally: the
insects sound lik e “the sweetest music, ” she f eels as though “her hear t wer e hiding” in the gr ass “ with the quail and the plo ver,” and
near the ridges she f eels “the futur e stirring. ”
Choice B is incorr ect because the quotation doesn ’t suggest that Alexandr a had a deep emotional connection t o her natur al
surroundings but instead describes how she inter acts with the people ar ound her t o learn mor e about cr ops, poultr y, and
experiments with clo ver ha y. Choice C is incorr ect because the quotation doesn ’t suggest that Alexandr a has a deep emotional
connection t o her natur al surr oundings but instead describes her nighttime depar ture in a wagon. The quotation sa ys nothing
about Alexandr a’s emotional state. Choice D is incorr ect because the quotation doesn ’t conv ey Alexandr a’s deep emotional
connection t o her natur al surr oundings; instead, this quotation describes how well she understands the mark ets and liv estock.

ID: 58e9e497  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of E uro-American farmers’ use of
Haudenosaunee agricultur al techniques. Accor ding t o the text, some E uro-American farmers wer e using these techniques in the
early nineteenth centur y despite f ew of the farmers ha ving seen Haudenosaunee farms. One explanation for these facts might be
that the farmers de veloped techniques on their own that alr eady had been inv ented centuries earlier b y the Haudenosaunee
people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If E uro-American farmers didn ’t learn these techniques fr om dir ect
obser vation of Haudenosaunee pr actices and didn ’t inv ent the techniques independently , then the most logical explanation is that
they learned the techniques fr om other people who wer e mor e dir ectly inﬂuenced b y Haudenosaunee pr actices than the farmers
themselv es wer e. Once the y learned about Haudenosaunee agricultur al pr actices, E uro-American farmers could then apply those
practices t o their own farming.
Choice B is incorr ect because the fact that some E uro-American farmers in the nor theastern United States wer e using
Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques wer e likely useful for the cr ops the farmers r aised, not that the cr ops
typically cultiv ated b y the farmers wer e not well suited t o Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers’ cr ops wer e ill suited
to the techniques, it’ s unlik ely that the farmers would ha ve used those techniques. Choice C is incorr ect because the text indicates
only that Haudenosaunee agricultur al techniques wer e used b y Euro-American farmers in the nor theastern United States, not that
these techniques wer e widely used outside this r egion. Choice D is incorr ect because the text states that some E uro-American

Choice B is the best answer . The text describes a sa ying in the capital that Malsufrido k eeps mor e secr ets than an ar chbishop. It
also sa ys that when he tak es off his hat, “the family secr ets do not ﬂy out… but r emain nicely bottled up, ” suggesting that he will

Linguist Debor ah Tannen has cautioned against fr aming contentious issues in terms of two highly competitiv e perspectiv es, such
as pr o versus con. Accor ding t o Tannen, this debate-driv en appr oach can strip issues of their complexity and, when used in fr ont
of an audience, can be less informativ e than the pr esentation of multiple perspectiv es in a noncompetitiv e format. To test
Tannen ’s hypothesis, students conducted a study in which the y showed par ticipants one of thr ee diff erent v ersions of local news

Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents the ﬁnding that, if true, would most str ongly suppor t Tannen ’s hypothesis.
Accor ding t o the text, Tannen ’s hypothesis is that multiple perspectiv es pr esented in a noncompetitiv e format is mor e informativ e

Choice A is incorr ect because ﬁnding that par ticipants per ceived commentat ors in the debate as mor e knowledgeable than

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of potential beneﬁts of interruptions in the
workplace. The text indicates that a common belief in business is that interruptions t o working emplo yees decr ease ener gy and
productivity le vels. Howe ver, the text goes on t o explain that a r esear ch team led b y Harshad Pur anik has found that ther e could be
a social beneﬁt t o these interruptions.  Since the team found that workplace interruptions can incr ease emplo yees’ sense of
belonging and job satisfaction, it follows that the interpersonal beneﬁts of some interruptions can offset the per ceived negativ e
effects. 
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text pr esents r esear ch ﬁndings that suggest some workplace interruptions can ha ve a positiv e
effect on emplo yee job satisfaction, no fur ther information is pr esented t o suggest at what fr equency these interruptions ar e ideal.
Furthermor e, the text doesn ’t tie workplace interruptions t o incr eased pr oductivity , but r ather links it t o social beneﬁts such as
sense of belonging. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess emplo yees’ motiv es for choosing not t o interrupt their
colleagues. The text pr esents r esear ch ﬁndings that suggest that ther e are some positiv e interpersonal eff ects of workplace
interruptions that can incr ease emplo yee job satisfaction. Choice D is incorr ect because asking businesses t o discour age
workplace interruptions doesn ’t follow fr om the team ’s resear ch about the beneﬁts of workplace interruptions, nor does the text

In 1534 CE, King Henr y VIII of England split with the Catholic Chur ch and declar ed himself head of the Chur ch of England, in par t

Which quotation fr om a scholarly ar ticle best suppor ts the asser tion of the hist orians mentioned in the text?
A. “At the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, about 2 per cent of the adult male population of England wer e monks; b y
1690, the pr opor tion of the adult male population who wer e monks was less than 1 per cent. ”

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The fact that Henr y VIII commissioned a sur vey of chur ch holdings just befor e enacting the
Dissolution of the Monasteries suggests that he was inter ested in the potential pr oﬁts fr om claiming their assets. This suppor ts
the hist orians’ asser tion.
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice describes a potential eff ect of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The decr ease in the
propor tion of monks in England isn ’t relevant t o the question of Henr y VIII’ s motiv ations. Choice B is incorr ect. Details about how
the monks wer e treated during the dissolution don ’t addr ess Henr y VIII’ s motiv ations for enacting the policy in the ﬁrst place. That
the monks could k eep the content of their cells (their r ooms) and sell off the timber the y’d har vested has no impact on the v alue of
the monasteries’ estates—their land holdings. Choice D is incorr ect. This choice mentions one impact that the Dissolution of the
Monasteries contributed t o, two y ears after it happened. But it doesn ’t help explain why Henr y VIII might ha ve wanted t o enact the
policy in the ﬁrst place.

Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the table t o suppor t the r esear chers’ conclusion about the
harvesting of clamshells b y Neander thals for use as t ools. The text explains that Neander thals used clamshells t o mak e tools and
that the stur diest, and ther efore the most desir able, shells for this purpose ar e found on the seaﬂoor , not on the beach. Howe ver,
the r esear chers also concluded that the clamshell t ools made fr om shells fr om the seaﬂoor ar e rarer than those made fr om shells
from the beach. Meanwhile the table shows that at each depth, the number of t ools made fr om shells fr om the beach ex ceeds the
number made fr om the mor e desir able shells fr om the seaﬂoor . The fact that the mor e desir able shells ar e less common suggests
that it was signiﬁcantly mor e diﬃcult t o har vest shells fr om the seaﬂoor than fr om the beach.
Choice B is incorr ect because knowing which depth r epresents the period of time with the highest Neander thal population does
not help answer the question of why the Neander thals consistently made mor e tools fr om the less desir able shells fr om the beach
than the y made fr om the mor e desir able shells fr om the seaﬂoor . Choice C is incorr ect because it claims that the beach shells ar eAssessment

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the quotation that most dir ectly illustr ates the claim that Whitman ’s poem
suggests that its r eaders ha ven’t fully underst ood themselv es. This quotation mak es that point dir ectly b y saying t o readers, “Y ou

“slumber ’d” and that their “ eyelids ha ve been the same as closed most of the time. ” 
Choice B is incorr ect because this quotation doesn ’t suggest that r eaders ha ven’t fully underst ood themselv es but instead
char acteriz es readers as “immense ” and “interminable. ” Although immense and interminable things can be diﬃcult t o understand,
this quotation doesn ’t mak e that point. Choice C is incorr ect because this quotation doesn ’t suggest that r eaders ha ven’t fully
underst ood themselv es but instead conv eys the speak er’s regret over not ha ving celebr ated r eaders sooner . In fact, this quotation
says nothing at all about r eaders themselv es—it’ s focused solely on the speak er’s feelings about r eaders. Choice D is incorr ect
because this quotation doesn ’t suggest that r eaders ha ven’t fully underst ood themselv es; instead, this quotation mak es the point

Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes Bilir oglu and colleagues’ claim about how the polar ons function
in relation t o superﬂuor escence. The text indicates that “until r ecently ,” superﬂuor escence (intense, synchr onized bursts of light
emitted b y dipoles) has solely been obser ved at v ery cold temper atures. Howe ver, it also states that, r ecently , Bilir oglu and
colleagues r epor t obser ving the phenomenon at r oom temper ature. They achie ved this using “thin ﬁlms made of per ovskite and
other similarly cr ystalline materials, ” which the r esear chers claim allows for the formation of polar ons. They also suggest that
these polar ons might absorb the thermal shocks that typically disrupt dipole synchr onization at warmer temper atures. Thus,
based on the text, Bilir oglu and colleagues belie ve that polar ons help dipoles synchr onize at temper atures well abo ve those at
which superﬂuor escence had pr eviously been obser ved.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess the pr ospect of a superﬂuor escent burst mo ving between cr ystalline
materials or any other mediums. Choice C is incorr ect because the text’ s discussion of polar ons is about how the y might enable
superﬂuor escence at higher temper atures than those at which it had pr eviously been obser ved. Rather than suggesting that
polar ons speed up superﬂuor escent bursts, the text suggests that no superﬂuor escence can occur at r oom temper ature in the
absence of polar ons. Thus, the text indicates that polar ons mak e superﬂuor escent bursts mor e likely to occur at higher
temper atures than those at which it had pr eviously been obser ved, not that polar ons acceler ate the bursts. Choice D is incorr ect
because the text’ s discussion of polar ons is about how the y might enable superﬂuor escence at higher temper atures than those at

Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses a quotation fr om O Pioneers!  to illustr ate the claim that Alexandr a
Bergson tak es comfor t in understanding the world ar ound her . In the quotation, Alexandr a is described as enjo ying looking at the
stars and f eeling a “ sense of personal security ” when she contemplates natur e’s order and its go verning laws. This suggests that
Alexandr a tak es comfor t in understanding the world ar ound her . 
Choice A is incorr ect because the quotation expr esses how Alexandr a Ber gson attempts t o meet diﬃcult situations with
determination, not how she tak es comfor t in understanding the world ar ound her . Choice B is incorr ect because the quotation
expr esses “how much the countr y meant t o” Alexandr a Ber gson, not how she tak es comfor t in understanding the world ar ound
her. In detailing some of the wildlif e surr ounding Alexandr a, the quotation conv eys that natur e is impor tant t o her but not
necessarily that it giv es her comfor t. Choice C is incorr ect because the quotation describes Alexandr a driving her wagon down a
highwa y at night; it doesn ’t describe how she tak es comfor t in understanding the world ar ound her or addr ess how she ’s feeling as

ID: ac285054  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the sweet potat o in P olynesia. The text
indicates that the sweet potat o is found in P olynesia but originated in South America, and that the sweet potat o was being
cultiv ated b y Nativ e Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples in P olynesia long befor e sea v oyages between South America and
Polynesia began. The text goes on t o note that r esear ch b y Muño z-Rodríguez and colleagues has established that the P olynesian
varieties of sweet potat o split fr om South American v arieties mor e than 100,000 y ears ago, which is thousands of y ears befor e
humans settled in P olynesia. If P olynesian peoples wer e cultiv ating the sweet potat o befor e sea v oyages between P olynesia and
South America began, and if P olynesian v arieties of sweet potat o div erged fr om South American v arieties well befor e people wer e
in Polynesia, it can r easonably be concluded that humans didn ’t pla y a role in bringing the sweet potat o to Polynesia. 
Choice A is incorr ect. The text doesn ’t provide any information about when the sweet potat o began t o be cultiv ated in South
America, so ther e’s no suppor t for the conclusion that cultiv ation began in P olynesia befor e it began in South America. Choice B is
incorr ect because the text indicates that the sweet potat o was being cultiv ated in P olynesia long befor e sea journe ys between
Polynesia and South America began. Ther efore, it wouldn ’t be r easonable t o conclude that P olynesian peoples acquir ed the sweet
potat o from South American peoples. Additionally , the text indicates that the P olynesian v arieties of sweet potat o div erged fr om
the South American v arieties thousands of y ears befor e people settled in P olynesia, which suggests that the sweet potat o was
already pr esent in P olynesia when people arriv ed. Choice D is incorr ect because the text states that the domestic sweet potat o,
which is found in P olynesia, descends fr om a wild South American plant, not fr om a domesticated South American plant. The only
people that the text describes as cultiv ating the sweet potat o are Nativ e Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples of P olynesia.

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The passage tells us that “tanks with duckweed (a ﬂoating plant) and algae r eleased higher le vels of

Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most str ongly suppor t the claim in the underlined
sentence. The text begins b y explaining that the por trayal of Mexican American cultur e in Sandr a Cisner os’s The House on Mango
Street inspir ed later authors t o explor e their own heritage. Noting that Cisner os’s no vella was also inﬂuential for its depiction of a
formativ e year in a f emale char acter ’s youth, the text then claims that this depiction inspir ed other Latina authors t o use ﬁction t o
explor e their own experiences of y outh. Since this claim addr esses how Cisner os encour aged Latina authors speciﬁcally t o por tray
their y outhful experiences, it would be dir ectly suppor ted b y such authors stating that her no vella inﬂuenced them t o write about
their own adolescence, or the tr ansitional period between childhood and adulthood.
Choice B is incorr ect. The text states that with its por trayal of Mexican American cultur e, The House on Mango Str eet inspir ed later
authors t o explor e their own heritage, and since this statement isn ’t limited t o only Latina authors, it can be inf erred that authors
who ar en’t Latina wer e also lik ely inﬂuenced b y the no vella. But because the claim in the underlined sentence concerns the
novella’s inﬂuence on Latina authors speciﬁcally , the ﬁnding that the book also inﬂuenced authors who wer en’t Latina would fail t o
provide suppor t for the claim. Choice C is incorr ect because the ﬁnding that The House on Mango Str eet has sold millions of
copies and is widely r ead among students in the US doesn ’t relate dir ectly t o the text’ s claim that the no vella has inﬂuenced Latina
authors speciﬁcally . Choice D is incorr ect. While comparisons of new no vels about y oung Latina char acters b y Latina authors t o
Cisner os’s The House on Mango Str eet would lik ely be founded on similarities between those no vels and Cisner os’s no vella, such
similarities wouldn ’t necessarily be e vidence of the no vella’s inﬂuence; such similarities might arise if Cisner os and y ounger Latina

Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about how hist orians view Siemomysł and Mieszko II Lamber t that is
suppor ted b y the text. The text states that the Piast dynasty had a number of diff erent members. The text r efers t o two of the
rulers in the Piast dynasty b y name: Mieszko II Lamber t, whose rule was known t o ha ve occurr ed fr om 1025 t o 1031 CE, and
Siemomysł (" whose hist orical actuality is disputed"), for whom less is known and who ther efore is the subject of debate among
historians. The text fur ther casts doubt about Siemomysł b y stating that he is " said t o ha ve ruled" during the 10th centur y, or the
900s, which suggests the possibility that he didn ’t rule. The text also mentions that the chr onicle ’s documentation of Siemomysł
relies on or al tradition, unlik e its r ecor ds of later rulers, including Mieszko II Lamber t. This indicates that hist orians agr ee that
Mieszko II Lamber t was an actual hist orical ﬁgur e, but the y disagr ee about whether Siemomysł existed.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text states that the Gesta principum P olonorum ’s documentation of Siemomysł comes fr om or al
tradition—spok en rather than written documentation—unlik e its r ecor ds of rulers who came after Siemomysł. This suggests that
the chr onicle pr ovides less r eliable e vidence r ather than mor e evidence for Siemomysł’ s existence in the 900s (or the 10th centur y)
than it does for later rulers lik e Mieszko II Lamber t, who ruled fr om 1025 t o 1031 CE. Choice C is incorr ect because the text
indicates the opposite: Siemomysł supposedly ruled earlier in the 10th centur y, while Mieszko II Lamber t ruled fr om 1025 t o 1031
CE. The 10th centur y spans the y ears fr om 901 t o 1000 CE, so Siemomysł is belie ved to ha ve ruled earlier than Mieszko II Lamber t
did, not later as this choice states. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text mentions that information in the written chr onicle Gesta
principum P olonorum  draws its information about Siemomysł fr om the or al tradition, it doesn ’t mention or ally tr ansmitted st ories
about Mieszko II Lamber t. Instead, it states that the chr onicle ’s documentation of Siemomysł r elies on or al tradition unlik e the
recor ds of later rulers do, which suggests that the documentation of later rulers such as Mieszko II Lamber t did not r ely on or al
tradition. Thus, no comparison can be made about how convincing the or ally tr ansmitted st ories of each ruler ar e to hist orians.

Choice A is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t justify the claim. The claim compar es the germination r ates of seeds exposed t o cer tain

Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t Gar dner and colleagues’ conclusion that
segments of the Missouri Riv er ﬂowing int o lak es tend t o carr y mor e sediment than do segments of the riv er ﬂowing out of lak es.
The text sa ys that riv ers appear y ellow when the y contain a lot of sediment and appear r ed when the y contain a lot of algae. It

wavelengths abo ve 560 nanometers and segments ﬂowing out of lak es tend t o ha ve wa velengths below 560 nanometers, this

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the morphology (form and structur e) of
sea stars, a type of echinoderm. The text indicates that echinoderms ha ve radially symmetrical body plans (symmetrical ar ound a
centr al point, usually in the form of a star), wher eas most animals ha ve bilater ally symmetrical body plans (symmetrical along an
axis running fr om head t o tail thr ough a trunk). Accor ding t o the text, sea stars ar e unusual echinoderms because, despite their
radial body plan, the y descended fr om known bilater al ancest ors. This shift in body plan was thought t o be a pr ocess of losing the
genetic mark ers associated with the head r egion. The text explains that b y comparing the genes of one sea star species ( P.
miniata ) to those of a close r elativ e, the acorn worm, r esear chers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes ar e activ e acr oss
the sea star ’s entir e body , posterior (tail) genes ar e activ e in limited, peripher al locations of the body , and no trunk-r elated genes
are activ e. This ﬁnding str ongly suggests that, r ather than becoming "headless" as the y evolved fr om a bilater al ancest or, sea stars
developed a body plan consisting almost entir ely of a head r egion with a minimal tail r egion and no trunk r egion pr esent.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t identify how any par ticular r egion of sea stars’ bodies inﬂuences the la yout of sea
stars’ r adial symmetr y. Mor eover, the text indicates that the r adial symmetr y of echinoderms is "usually starlik e," not that a starlik e
layout distinguishes sea stars fr om other echinoderms. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that the idea that
sea stars e volved fr om an ancest or with bilater al symmetr y is incorr ect (describing the bilater al origin as "known ") and doesn ’t

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the e volution of bipedalism in humans.
Accor ding t o the text, one potential explanation for humans walking upright on two legs is that the beha vior e volved fr om an

ﬁnding that or angutans, also a r elativ e of humans, sometimes stand on two legs in tr ees while using their arms t o balance and

because it off ered an adv antage, such as access t o cer tain foods.
Choice B is incorr ect because the ﬁnding that modern or angutans (a r elativ e of humans) sometimes stand on two legs in tr ees

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a quotation that illustr ates the claim that Mrs. Spring F ragrance demonstr ates
concern for what’ s happening at home while she ’s in California. By giving r eminders t o “care for the cat, the bir ds, and the ﬂowers, ”
“not eat t oo quickly ,” and a void engaging in str enuous activity in the heat, Mrs. Spring F ragrance shows that she ’s thinking about
what’ s happening at home and wants t o ensur e everything is tak en car e of.
Choice A is incorr ect because the quotation, while it does suggest that Mrs. Spring F ragrance has made fudge at home befor e, is
focused on pr epar ations for an upcoming f estiv al, not on concerns for anything happening at home while Mrs. Spring F ragrance is
away. Choice B is incorr ect because the quotation has t o do with an upcoming e vent during Mrs. Spring F ragrance ’s trip—visiting
San José and meeting someone new—r ather than her concern for what’ s happening at home. Choice D is incorr ect because the
quotation is focused on how Mrs. Spring F ragrance f eels about her trip and the friends she ’s seeing, not on her concern for what’ s

Although it’ s clear that Mars once had liquid water on its sur face, astr onomers ha ve debated whether the e vidence of ancient

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . This choice pr ovides dir ect suppor t for the r esear chers’ conclusion. If the basin once held an ocean
of liquid water for " an extended time, " that suppor ts the " wet and warm scenario " on Mars, which inv olved a " prolonged" period of
temper ate conditions (and not just a "brief period of melting").
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t provide suppor t for the r esear chers’ conclusions. The dimensions of the basin ha ve little
bearing on whether or not it was ﬁlled with liquid water , and for how long, and that’ s the e vidence that would suppor t the " wet and
warm " theor y. Similarly , whether or not the basin was formed b y an aster oid or a comet is irr elevant t o the question of whether or
not ther e was water in the basin for a long period. Choice C is incorr ect. This choice does not pr ovide suppor t for the r esear chers’
conclusions, but r ather the opposite. A " massiv e but shor t lived inﬂux" of liquid water is not the same as a " prolonged phase of
warm, wet conditions. " It mor e reﬂects the opposing theor y, a "brief period of melting. " Choice D is incorr ect. This choice does not
suppor t Car denas and Lamb ’s conclusion. Both theories about liquid water on Mars (" wet and warm " and "brief period of melting")

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the gr aph t o complete the statement about Mahtta et al. ’s
proposal r egar ding fact ors that aff ect urban land expansion (ULE). Accor ding t o the text, ULE is inﬂuenced b y urban population
growth and b y gross domestic pr oduct (GDP) gr owth per capita. Reasoning that eﬃcient national go vernments pr ovide urban
services and infr astructur e needed t o attr act economic inv estment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as go vernments become mor e
eﬃcient at pr oviding urban ser vices and infr astructur e, GDP gr owth per capita will account for mor e ULE and urban population
growth will account for less. But accor ding t o the gr aph, Region 1 saw an incr ease in the per centage attributed t o urban population
growth fr om 1970–2000 (between 60 and 65%) t o 2000–2014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decr ease in the per centage attributed
to GDP gr owth per capita fr om 1970–2000 (between 35 and 40%) t o 2000–2014 (about 25%). Because the per centage attributed
to GDP gr owth per capita decr eased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the go vernments had become
more eﬃcient), the data suggest that the go vernments of Region 1 became less eﬃcient at pr oviding urban ser vices and
infrastructur e over that period.
Choice B is incorr ect. Neither the gr aph nor the text giv es the r egions’ r elativ e levels of economic gr owth or what eff ect Mahtta et
al. would expect such gr owth t o ha ve. Furthermor e, Mahtta et al. ’s proposal suggests that Region 1’ s decline in the per centage of
ULE attributed t o GDP gr owth per capita fr om 1970–2000 (between 35 and 40%) t o 2000–2014 (about 25%) would suggest
decr easing, not incr easing, go vernment eﬃciency o ver this time. Choice C is incorr ect. Neither the text nor the gr aph pr ovides
information about the r elativ e eﬃciencies of diff erent go vernments in Region 2. Choice D is incorr ect. Mahtta et al. ’s proposal
suggests that mor e eﬃcient go vernments will ha ve a higher per centage of their ULE driv en b y GDP gr owth per capita and a lower
percentage driv en b y urban population gr owth. F or Region 2, the per centage of ULE attributed t o GDP gr owth per capita incr eased
from 1970–2000 (between 10 and 15%) t o 2000–2014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the
percentage of ULE attributed t o GDP gr owth per capita decline o ver the same period. Thus, wher eas the data suggest
governments in Region 2 became mor e eﬃcient, the data for Region 1 suggest that those go vernments became less eﬃcient, not

Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about the site disco vered b y the r esear chers that is suppor ted b y the
text. The text discusses Fior elli and colleagues’ disco very of egg clutches, single eggs, and eggshells in a Br azilian mine.
Accor ding t o the text, the pr esence of these eggs, which ar e from the Late Cr etaceous period, led the r esear chers t o conclude that
the location was once a nesting and br eeding site for titanosaurs. The text then explains that the ﬁnding is impor tant because of
the “ previous lack of known nesting sites in nor thern r egions of South America. ” If ther e ha ven’t been any other disco veries of a
nesting site in South America ’s nor thern r egions and the site in the Br azilian mine is the ﬁrst, then the text str ongly suggests that
the site is far ther nor th than other nesting sites that ha ve been disco vered in South America. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that the site disco vered b y Fior elli and colleagues is the earliest titanosaur
nesting and br eeding site known t o paleont ologists but r ather that it’ s the ﬁrst nesting site found in nor thern r egions of South
America. Mor eover, the text doesn ’t suggest how the timeline of the newly disco vered site compar es with that of other titanosaur
nesting and br eeding sites. Choice B is incorr ect because ther e is no mention in the text about any diﬃculties that Fior elli and
colleagues faced when the y wer e excavating the nesting and br eeding site in the Br azilian mine. Choice C is incorr ect because the
text doesn ’t suppor t the idea that the nesting and br eeding site in the Br azilian mine was occupied b y saur opods other than

Songbir ds learn t o respond t o and imitate their species’ songs fr om an early age. With each gener ation, small diff erences ar e
introduced that r esult in distinct v ariations—called dialects—among geogr aphically isolated populations of the same species. A
resear ch study examined whether twelv e-da y-old Ficedula hypoleuca  (pied ﬂy catcher) nestlings pr efer local dialects o ver the
unfamiliar dialects of nonlocal F. hypoleuca populations: the mor e begging calls the nestlings made in r esponse t o a song, the
stronger their pr eference. The r esear chers found that nestlings pr oduced mor e begging calls in r esponse t o their own dialect than
to nonlocal dialects. Since song pr eference pla ys a r ole in songbir d mate selection, the ﬁnding suggests that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. F. hypoleuca nestlings’ pr eference for their own dialect lik ely disappears as the y matur e to promote socialization between
different F. hypoleuca  populations.
B. F. hypoleuca nestlings who show an early pr eference for their own dialect ar e likely to receiv e mor e food fr om their car etak ers
than nestlings who show no pr eferences among any F. hypoleuca  dialects. 
C. F. hypoleuca  nestlings’ pr eference for their own dialect lik ely driv es them when the y matur e to reproduce with other F.
hypoleuca  from local r ather than nonlocal populations.  
D. F. hypoleuca nestlings show a pr eference for both local F. hypoleuca  dialects and the songs of other local songbir ds o ver the
songs of nonlocal bir ds of any species.
ID: db876f d5 Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . Because “ song pr eference pla ys a r ole in songbir d mate selection, ” and because F. hypoleuca
nestlings displa y a pr eference for local dialects, we can inf er that the y will be mor e likely to choose mates fr om local populations.
Choice A is incorr ect. W e don ’t ha ve any information suggesting that this pr eference disappears, so ther e’s no basis for this
inference. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the passage discusses the number of begging calls made in r esponse t o various F.
hypoleuca  dialects, no mention is made about the amount of food r eceiv ed based on dialect pr eference. Ther efore, ther e’s no
basis for this inf erence. Choice D is incorr ect. Ther e’s no mention in the passage of methods of other types of local songbir ds, so
there’s no basis for this inf erence.

In the 1980s, many musicians and journalists in the English-speaking world began t o draw attention t o music fr om ar ound the
globe—such as mbaqanga fr om South Africa and quan họ fr om Vietnam—that can ’t be easily categoriz ed accor ding t o British or
North American popular music genr es, typically r eferring t o such music as “ world music. ” While some scholars ha ve welcomed
this de velopment for bringing div erse musical forms t o prominence in countries wher e the y’d previously been o verlook ed,
musicologist Su Zheng claims that the concept of world music homogeniz es highly distinct tr aditions b y reducing them all t o a
single categor y.
Which ﬁnding about mbaqanga and quan họ, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t Zheng’ s claim?
A. Mbaqanga and quan họ de veloped independently of each other and ha ve little in common musically .
B. Mbaqanga is signiﬁcantly mor e popular in the English-speaking world than quan họ is. 
C. Mbaqanga and quan họ ar e now per formed b y a div erse arr ay of musicians with no dir ect connections t o South Africa or

D. Mbaqanga and quan họ ar e highly distinct fr om British and Nor th American popular music genr es but similar t o each other .
ID: 09f9edb0  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . Zheng’ s claim is that the idea of world music “homogeniz es” (meaning mak es similar) distinct kinds
of music b y reducing them t o one categor y. In other wor ds, Zheng thinks the concept of world music is a harmful
oversimpliﬁcation of div erse musical forms. To suppor t this claim, we need e vidence that these musical tr aditions ar e so diff erent
from one another that the y should not fall int o the same categor y. If it’ s true that mbaqanga and quan họ de veloped separ ately and
have little in common musically , then it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o lump them int o the same categor y.
Choice B is incorr ect. If true, this wouldn ’t aff ect the claim. To suppor t the claim, we need e vidence that these musical tr aditions
are so diff erent fr om one another that the y should not fall int o the same categor y. A diff erence in popularity doesn ’t necessarily
mean that the two musical tr aditions shouldn ’t be categoriz ed together: instead, we need t o know if the music itself is similar or
different. Choice C is incorr ect. If true, this wouldn ’t aff ect the claim. To suppor t the claim, we need e vidence that these musical
traditions ar e so diff erent fr om each other that the y should not fall int o the same categor y. This choice doesn ’t do that. Choice D is
incorr ect. If true, this would actually weak en the claim. Zheng thinks it’ s reductiv e or o versimplifying t o put distinct musical
traditions int o a single categor y. But if mbaqanga and quan họ ar e similar t o each other , then it would mak e sense t o put them in
the same categor y.

Choice B is the best answer because it describes data fr om the gr aph that best suppor t the student’ s asser tion that initial effor ts
at trade liber alization in China wer e shaped b y ﬁrms ha ving limited capital (assets a vailable for use) and that this situation
resolv ed during the 2000s. The text explains that an appr oach t o trade liber alization inv olves engaging in pr ocessing impor ts, one
type of which doesn ’t requir e pa yment t o a tr ade par tner (pr ocessing with assembly) and one type of which r equir es upfr ont
payment t o a tr ade par tner for r aw materials (pr ocessing with inputs). The gr aph, which pr esents China ’s impor ts for or dinar y
impor ts and both types of pr ocessing impor ts in the y ears 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while pr ocessing impor ts with
assembly r ose fr om about 250 hundr ed million dollars in 2000 t o about 750 hundr ed million dollars in 2006, pr ocessing impor ts
with inputs r ose much mor e sharply , incr easing fr om appr oximately 650 hundr ed million dollars in 2000 t o about 2,300 hundr ed
million dollars in 2006. Because pr ocessing with inputs r equir es ﬁrms t o pa y for materials (expending capital) and pr ocessing with
assembly doesn ’t, the sharper rise in pr ocessing impor ts with inputs suggests that Chinese ﬁrms’ assets—and thus their ability t o
engage in that type of pr ocessing impor ts—wer e relativ ely limited in (and befor e) 2000 and then substantially incr eased fr om 2000
to 2006. In other wor ds, the data suggest that the situation of ha ving limited capital r esolv ed during the 2000s.
Choice A is incorr ect because the gr aph indicates that or dinar y impor ts wer e greater than both types of pr ocessing impor ts in
2006, not that pr ocessing impor ts with inputs wer e greater than or dinar y impor ts and pr ocessing impor ts with assembly that y ear.
Choice C is incorr ect because the obser vation that or dinar y impor ts wer e greater than both types of pr ocessing impor ts in 2000,
2003, and 2006 doesn ’t addr ess a change within any type of impor ts from 2000 t o 2006, and an indication of a change in that
period that might be r elated t o the a vailability of assets is needed t o suppor t the asser tion that the situation of ha ving limited
capital r esolv ed during the 2000s. Choice D is incorr ect because the fact that pr ocessing impor ts with assembly wer e greater at
the end of the period fr om 2000 t o 2006 than pr ocessing impor ts with inputs wer e at the star t of the same period doesn ’t addr ess
a change within either type of impor ts during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be r elated t o the a vailability

ID: f39507a3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the
challenge r esear chers face when studying the eff ects of holding elected oﬃce on a person ’s beha vior. The text explains that it’ s
hard for r esear chers t o test for the eff ects that elected oﬃce has on people because ﬁnding people t o ser ve as a contr ol gr oup is
diﬃcult. The text indicates that a contr ol gr oup needs t o be made up of people who shar e char acteristics of the gr oup being tested
but don ’t ha ve the v ariable being tested (in this case, holding elected oﬃce). Because r esear chers ar en’t able t o inﬂuence who
wins elections, the y’re also unable t o determine who would ser ve as an appr opriately similar member of a contr ol gr oup. Thus, it
logically follows that r esear chers will ﬁnd it diﬃcult t o identify a gr oup of people who can function as an appr opriate contr ol gr oup
for their studies.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text focuses on the struggle t o put t ogether a contr ol gr oup for experiments; it doesn ’t suggest
that ﬁnding information about politicians’ beha vior is diﬃcult. Choice B is incorr ect because the experiments mentioned in the text
are testing the eff ects of holding elected oﬃce on a person ’s beha vior. Studying people who ha ve alr eady held elected oﬃce
wouldn ’t provide an oppor tunity t o note any beha vioral changes that the position might cause. Choice C is incorr ect because the
text deﬁnes people in a contr ol gr oup as those " who ar e other wise similar t o the oﬃce-holders"; selecting people who diff er from
the oﬃce-holders wouldn ’t ﬁt the criteria for an appr opriate contr ol gr oup.

Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text begins b y stating that the Black

to the text, this pr ogram off ers community members the oppor tunity t o learn some basics about conducting and then apply what
they learn b y conducting the or chestr a themselv es. Thus, the main idea of the text is that community members can both listen t o

Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text states that the Black P earl or chestr a is based in Philadelphia, it doesn ’t indicate that most

Choice B is the best answer . The text tells us that “ people who got t o touch the items wer e willing t o pa y much mor e mone y for

mak e it seem mor e valuable t o a shopper .
Choice A is incorr ect. The text doesn ’t discuss how much people spend each month, so ther e’s not much basis for this claim.
Furthermor e, since being able t o touch a pr oduct tends t o mak e people “ willing t o pa y much mor e mone y” for it, we might pr edict
that an online shopper would be willing t o spend less on the same pur chases as an in-person shopper . Choice C is incorr ect. The
text doesn ’t discuss what r etailers “ should char ge,” so ther e’s not much basis for this claim. F urthermor e, the study in the text
suggests that in-person st ores ma y actually be able t o char ge mor e for a giv en pr oduct, since shoppers can t ouch it. Choice D is
incorr ect. The text doesn ’t discuss pr oducts that ar e only a vailable online, so ther e’s not much basis for this claim. F urthermor e,
products only a vailable online would still ha ve the pr oblem of shoppers not being able t o touch them, and the study suggests that

requir es initial inv estments (in extr activ e technology , for instance) at scales best met b y multinational corpor ations—but Asiedu
notes that natur al-resour ce industries’ boom-bust cy cle can destabiliz e local curr encies and incr ease de veloping countries’
vulner ability t o external shocks, cr eating le vels of uncer tainty t o which for eign inv estors ar e typically a verse.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Although it ma y seem surprising that for eign inv estment declines in de veloping countries as natur al-resour ce extr action mak es
up a lar ger shar e of those countries’ economies, that decline happens because r esour ce extr action r equir es initial inv estments
too lar ge for for eign inv estors t o supply . 
B. Although de veloping countries tend t o become less dependent on for eign inv estment as natur al-resour ce industries mak e up a

currencies or incr eases countries’ vulner ability t o external shocks. 
C. Although one might expect that for eign inv estment would incr ease as natur al-resour ce extr action mak es up a lar ger shar e of
developing countries’ economies, the opposite happens because hea vy reliance on natur al resour ces can lead t o unattr activ e
conditions for inv estors.

Choice C is the best answer because it accur ately states the main idea of the text. Accor ding t o the text, contr ary to what some
might expect, for eign inv estment is typically lower in de veloping countries whose economies ar e mor e dependent on natur al-
resour ce extr action. The text explains that high r eliance on natur al-resour ce extr action can subject a de veloping countr y to
economic shocks that can destabiliz e the local curr ency and intr oduce economic uncer tainty that tends t o keep inv estors awa y. In
other wor ds, although we ma y think other wise, for eign inv estors ar e less willing t o inv est in pr ojects in de veloping countries whose
economies ar e hea vily dependent on natur al-resour ce extr action because those economies tend t o exhibit instability that inv estors
want t o avoid.
Choice A is incorr ect. The text does indicate that for eign inv estment is typically lower in de veloping countries whose economies
are mor e dependent on natur al-resour ce extr action; the text fur ther indicates that natur al-resour ce extr action r equir es substantial
initial inv estments (t o acquir e things lik e requir ed technologies) for which ther e are fewer inv estors willing t o par ticipate at this
stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial inv estments as a r eason why for eign

Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the student’ s claim that putting

American thr ashers that this hypothesis was not fully suppor ted. In other wor ds, Pr obst and colleagues did not obser ve the
predicted positiv e relationship between mean bill sur face ar ea and habitat temper ature in the thr ashers the y studied. The data in
the table about the ocellated thr asher suppor t Probst and colleagues’ conclusion because this species has the gr eatest mean bill
surface ar ea (3.26 cm ), but its habitat has the lowest mean maximum temper ature in the warmest month (27.56°C ). If the
hypothesis wer e fully suppor ted, species such as the ocellated thr asher that ha ve colder habitats would lik ely also ha ve smaller
bills. Similarly , the data about the Bendir e’s thr asher suppor t Probst and colleagues’ conclusion because this species has the
second-smallest mean bill sur face ar ea (1.98 cm ), yet its habitat has the highest mean maximum temper ature in the warmest
month (36.57°C ). If the hypothesis wer e fully suppor ted, the Bendir e’s thr asher and other species with warmer habitats would also
have lar ger bills. Because data in the table show that the ocellated thr asher and the Bendir e’s thr asher ha ve the opposite or near
opposite of the hypothesiz ed relationship between bill siz e and habitat temper ature, these examples suppor t Probst and
colleagues’ conclusion that this hypothesis isn ’t fully suppor ted.
Choice A is incorr ect because it misr epresents the data in the table. Although the Bendir e’s thr asher has the second-smallest
mean bill sur face ar ea of the species that ar e included in the table and although its habitat has the second-lowest mean minimum
temper ature in the coldest month, this habitat has the highest (r ather than the lowest) mean maximum temper ature in the
warmest month. Mor eover, the data about this species’ bill sur face ar ea and mean minimum temper ature suggest that smaller
bills ar e associated with colder habitats, suppor ting r ather than challenging the hypothesis that bill siz e incr eases with habitat
temper ature. Choice B is incorr ect because it misr epresents the data in the table. Although the Co zumel thr asher has the second-
greatest mean bill sur face ar ea of the species that ar e included in the table, its habitat’ s mean maximum temper ature in the
warmest month is not " signiﬁcantly higher " than the mean maximum temper atures of the other habitats. On the contr ary, the mean
maximum temper ature of the Co zumel thr asher ’s habitat is lower than that obser ved for the habitats of both the Bendir e’s thr asher
and the long-billed thr asher . Choice C is incorr ect because it misr epresents the data in the table. Although this choice accur ately
describes the br own thr asher ’s mean bill sur face ar ea and habitat temper ature, it incorr ectly states that the long-billed thr asher
has the second-lar gest (r ather than the thir d-lar gest) mean bill sur face ar ea of the species included. In addition, instead of
revealing a lack of suppor t for the hypothesis that bill siz e incr eases with habitat temper ature, the data in this choice br oadly

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the table t o complete the statement, pr oviding an example of
how the people of the Na vajo Nation can experience diff erent climate conditions depending on wher e the y live. The table shows
the a verage highest temper atures and a verage lowest temper atures in four locations in the Na vajo Nation in July . Accor ding t o the

at 99°. This diff erence illustr ates the statement that the people of the Na vajo Nation can experience diff erent climate conditions
depending on wher e the y live.
Choice A is incorr ect because it states that Camer on and Teec Nos P os had the same a verage lowest temper ature (65°) for July ,
which suggests a similarity in climate conditions in those locations r ather than a diff erence. Choice B is incorr ect because it

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . Chur chill’ s pla y was inﬂuenced b y Brecht’ s belief that theater should elicit an intellectual r ather than
an emotional r esponse fr om audiences, making them think about social and political issues that also exist outside of the pla y.
Ther efore, it mak es sense that Chur chill would striv e to ha ve audiences think dispassionately (i.e., without emotion) and critically
about the social and political questions r aised b y the pla y.
Choice A is incorr ect. The passage mentions that Chur chill was inﬂuenced b y Brecht’ s belief that pla ys should pr ovoke audience
members “t o consider social and political r ealities that extend be yond the char acters and e vents depicted onstage, ” so ther e’s no
basis for an inf erence about audience members deeply engaging with char acters’ beliefs and actions. Choice B is incorr ect.
Reﬂecting on things that ar en’t related t o patriar chy and colonialism wouldn ’t “engage audiences in an interr ogation of patriar chy
and colonialism. ” That cr eates a confusing contr adiction. Choice C is incorr ect. No mention is made of social and political issues
in Germany during Br echt’ s time, so ther e’s no basis for this inf erence.

Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text states that some scholars ha ve

historical context. The text goes on t o sa y that while it is “ not inconceiv able that Beowulf  emer ged fr om such a context”—that is, it
is possible that Beowulf  was composed during the late ninth thr ough ele venth centuries—ther e is linguistic e vidence that the poem
was composed earlier , in the se venth or eighth centur y. Accor ding t o the text, fa voring the hist orical context o ver the linguistic
evidence r equir es justiﬁcation that scholars ha ve not y et supplied. In other wor ds, the text suggests that scholars who fa vor the
later composition date need t o explain why the poem ’s ﬁt with hist orical context should tak e precedence o ver the linguistic

composition date, adv ocates for the later date ha ve not compellingly addr essed e vidence suggestiv e of an earlier date. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text sa ys that scholars who date the poem t o the late ninth thr ough early ele venth centuries
have failed t o account for the linguistic e vidence that the poem ma y have been composed earlier , not that the e vidence those
scholars cite in fa vor of their view is unr eliable or that any one has cast doubt on that e vidence. In other wor ds, the text does not
suggest that ther e are problems with the e vidence cited b y adv ocates of the later composition date, only that ther e is other
evidence of an earlier composition date that those adv ocates need t o consider . Choice B is incorr ect because nothing in the text
suggests that those scholars who date the poem t o the late ninth thr ough early ele venth centuries ar e giving priority t o a

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The text sa ys that the cer ebellum has long been thought t o regulate mot or functioning, but new
resear ch shows that it ma y also ha ve other functions—including r egulating emotion and social beha vior and some connection t o
motiv ation and r ewar ds pr ocessing.
Choice A is incorr ect. The VT A is described as “ a center for motiv ation and r ewar d processing, ” and the disco very of the pathwa y
between the VT A and the cer ebellum suppor ts the theor y that the cer ebellum is inv olved in functions other than mot or
coor dination. Choice B is incorr ect. The text sa ys that r ecent r esear ch has identiﬁed this pathwa y, but it doesn ’t discuss any
previous “ widely accepted claims” about the pathwa y’s function. The “ widespr ead acknowledgement” mentioned early in the
passage is about the cer ebellum alone, not its connection t o the VT A. Choice D is incorr ect. The text ne ver discusses any
technological limitations or any new technologies.

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most str ongly suppor t the team ’s conclusion that
cattle wer e likely raised closer t o human settlements than sheep and goats wer e. The text explains that V aiglo va, Liu, and their

cattle f ed on millet—impor tantly , a cr op cultiv ated b y humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle ’s diet also
consisted of wheat, another cr op cultiv ated b y humans in China during the Br onze Age, the ﬁnding would suppor t the team ’s
conclusion b y off ering additional e vidence that cattle during this er a fed on human-gr own cr ops—and, b y extension, that humans
raised cattle r elativ ely close t o the settlements wher e the y grew these cr ops, lea ving goats and sheep t o roam far ther awa y in
areas with wild v egetation, uncultiv ated b y humans.
Choice B is incorr ect because if it wer e true that sheep ’s and goats’ diets consisted of small por tions of millet, which the text
states was a cr op cultiv ated b y humans, the ﬁnding would suggest that sheep and goats wer e raised r elativ ely close t o human

wouldn ’t suppor t the team ’s conclusion that cattle wer e likely raised closer t o human settlements than sheep and goats wer e.
Nothing in the text suggests that cattle wer e incapable of obtaining suﬃcient food and nutrients without access t o human-gr own
crops. Hence, e ven if cattle ’s diets ar e found t o ha ve diff erent r equir ements than the diets of sheep and goats, the cattle could

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of scholars’
understanding of Ma ya ecology and agricultur al mark etplaces. The text indicates that scholars used t o belie ve that during the
Classic period, the Ma ya civilization didn ’t ha ve agricultur al mark etplaces. Accor ding t o the text, scholars held this view because
they misunderst ood the ecology of ar eas wher e the Ma ya lived. The text points out that people tend t o create mark etplaces in
order t o acquir e resour ces the y don ’t other wise contr ol. Agricultur al mark etplaces would ha ve allowed farmers who pr oduced one
type of cr op to trade that cr op for other types of cr ops that the y didn ’t produce. The text goes on t o sa y, howe ver, that scholars
under estimated the ecological div ersity of the Ma ya areas, meaning that scholars thought that the Ma ya landscape pr oduced a
smaller r ange of r esour ces than it actually pr oduced. Taken together , then, this information suggests that scholars assumed that
mark etplaces wouldn ’t ha ve allowed Ma ya people t o acquir e products diff erent fr om the pr oducts the y already pr oduced: that is, if
everyone pr oduced the same arr ay of cr ops, as scholars mistak enly belie ved, then ther e wouldn ’t ha ve been any need for
mark etplaces wher e people could tr ade those cr ops.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t say anything about tr ade between the Ma ya and people fr om outside the r egions
contr olled b y the Ma ya. Although scholars’ mistak en belief that the Ma ya lands wer en’t very ecologically div erse would giv e those
scholars a r eason t o think that the Ma ya didn ’t ha ve mark etplaces, it wouldn ’t lead scholars t o assume that tr aders fr om outside
Maya lands wer e uninter ested in acquiring r esour ces pr oduced b y the Ma ya. Even if the Ma ya actually did pr oduce only a small
array of r esour ces thr oughout their lands, ther e is no r eason t o belie ve from the text that people outside Ma ya lands also pr oduced
these same r esour ces and thus would ha ve no need t o trade with the Ma ya people. Choice B is incorr ect because the text
indicates that scholars under estimated the ecological div ersity of the Ma ya lands, which suggests that the y mistak enly belie ved
that the Ma ya produced a r elativ ely small arr ay of r esour ces thr oughout their territ ory, not that the cr ops the Ma ya produced v aried

Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text begins b y acknowledging that in

Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents the inf erence that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the genetic

vicuña), while llamas get 95.5 per cent of their genetic material fr om their wild ancest or (the guanaco). These data imply that
relativ e to llamas, alpacas ha ve experienced a much gr eater genetic shift awa y from their wild ancest ors (36 per cent of their

that the r emainder of alpacas’ genetic material deriv es fr om llamas, and the r emainder of llamas’ genetic material deriv es fr om
alpacas, r eﬂecting a period of interbr eeding. Taken together , these details suppor t the inf erence that the period of interbr eeding
had a mor e signiﬁcant impact on the genetic material of alpacas than on that of llamas, ther eby reducing the per centage of
alpacas’ genetic material that deriv es fr om wild ancest ors and placing alpacas at a gr eater r emo ve from these ancest ors.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t provide information about genetic div ersity within modern llama and alpaca
populations. While the text discusses the per centage of genetic material each domesticated species inherited fr om its wild

years ago, but the interbr eeding with llamas occurr ed "between 400 and 600 y ears ago. " The genetic mixing happened thousands
of years after domestication, not during it; in addition, the text does not pr ovide details about what the pr ocess of domestication
might entail. Ther efore, it isn ’t logical t o inf er that llama genetic material was intr oduced during the domestication pr ocess of
alpacas. Choice D is incorr ect because though the text notes that guanacos and vicuñas contributed t o the genetic material of

Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents an explanation about a helicopter that is dir ectly suppor ted b y the text. The text

Poetry in Classical Nahuatl, the language of the A ztec Empir e, relies on difrasismo , or a par allel noun construction that

ID: d0f51067  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that dog owners
typically claim that some dog br eeds ar e “more likely than others t o ha ve par ticular personality tr aits.” In other wor ds, the text
points out that a commonly held belief about dog br eeds is that their personality tr aits ar e heritable. The text then states that
Kathleen Morrill and colleagues under took r esear ch about dog tr ait heritability and found that “beha vior v aries widely among dogs
of the same br eed.” Because Morrill and colleagues found e vidence for v ariability r ather than consistency in the beha vior of dogs
of the same br eed, the statement that r esear ch fails t o uphold a commonly held belief about dog br eeds and beha vior accur ately
reﬂects the main idea of the text.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text mentions that humans ha ve long inter vened in dogs’ r eproduction b y intentionally
crossbr eeding cer tain dogs, it doesn ’t argue that such inter vention is essential t o the existence of dog br eeds. Choice C is
incorr ect because the text doesn ’t discuss the popularity of any dog br eeds; br eeds ar e mentioned as ha ving cer tain tr aits, but the
text sa ys nothing about the popularity of these br eeds or tr aits. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text brieﬂy mentions that
Morrill and colleagues conducted a study about dog tr aits using both sur veys and DN A sequencing, this is not the main focus of
the text. The text concerns the study ’s results about the heritability of dog tr aits, not the par ticular methodology used b y Morrill

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the mechanisms underlying associativ e
memor y. The text explains that fan cells—a type of br ain cell—ar e necessar y for the acquisition of new associativ e memories, and
that activity among these cells r equir es a chemical known as dopamine, which the br ain pr oduces in r esponse t o rewar ds. Since
the br ain cells that enable the formation of associativ e memories r equir e dopamine in or der t o function, and since the br ain
produces dopamine in r esponse t o rewar ds, it can be inf erred that r eceiving a r ewar d should lik ely help t o incr ease an individual’ s
capacity t o form associativ e memories.
Choice A is incorr ect because the r elationship between r ewar ds and dopamine sk etched b y the text is that r ewar ds result in the
production of dopamine, not that the y cause an individual’ s capacity t o utiliz e dopamine t o decr ease. Choice B is incorr ect. The
text suggests that r eceiving a r ewar d would pr oduce dopamine and ther eby assist with associativ e memor y formation. Howe ver,
the text ne ver suggests that associativ e memor y inv olves the capacity t o recogniz e diff erences between unr elated things,

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of militar y
veterans working in civilian go vernment jobs in the United States. The text indicates that the pr opor tion of militar y veterans
working in civilian go vernment jobs is consider ably higher than the pr opor tion of militar y veterans in the population as a whole.
The text also notes that the unusually high r epresentation of militar y veterans in these jobs ma y be a r esult of the or ganizational
structur es  shar ed b y civilian go vernment entities and the militar y. Hence, it’ s reasonable t o inf er that it’ s the familiarity of the

Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess what a typical r elationship between militar y ser vice and later car eer
preferences would be, and ther e’s no indication that it’ s atypical for v eterans t o work in civilian go vernment jobs after the y’ve left

the text is focused on the high r epresentation of militar y veterans in civilian go vernment jobs and doesn ’t addr ess nonv eterans or
their possible inter est in militar y ser vice. Choice D is incorr ect because the text conv eys that militar y veterans ma y be par ticularly

Choice D is the best answer . Cooling magma would cr eate basalt, but “ a planetar y sur face that formed in a mostly basaltic

Choice D is the best answer because it states why W ang and his team ’s disco very of the Terropterus xiushanensis  fossil was

Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text states that W ang and his team identiﬁed fossiliz ed remains of a mix opterid species that

Choice A is incorr ect. Despite these pieces containing " a rare form of lead, " ther e is no dir ect claim in the passage that Shang
dynasty br onze is itself mor e rare or v aluable than br onze pieces fr om other periods. Ther efore, ther e’s no basis for this inf erence.
Choice C is incorr ect. Although the passage mentions that the natur e of the br onze in Chinese ar tifacts changed after the Shang

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it describes data fr om the gr aph that weak en the student’ s conclusion about the r eduction in
the spider population in the enclosur e with lizar ds. The gr aph shows that the enclosur e with lizar ds and the enclosur e without
lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosur e fell over the 30 da ys of the study . The
student’ s claim is that the r eduction in spiders in the enclosur e with lizar ds is “ entir ely attributable t o the pr esence of the lizar ds,”
meaning that the spider population wouldn ’t ha ve declined ex cept for the pr esence of the lizar ds. This claim is weak ened, howe ver,
by the fact that the enclosur e without lizar ds also saw a substantial r eduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of
spiders f ell in the enclosur e without lizar ds as well as in the enclosur e with lizar ds, ther e must be some other fact or than just the

Choice A is incorr ect because the fact that the two enclosur es star ted with the same number of spiders is irr elevant t o the claim
that the r eduction in spider population b y day 30 in the enclosur e with lizar ds can be entir ely attributed t o the lizar ds. Choice C is
incorr ect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosur e with lizar ds fell mor e between da ys 1 and 10 than in other

Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the

enormous siz es, and it notes that some scientists ha ve asser ted that the cause of this phenomenon was incr eased plant

about atmospheric carbon dio xide le vels is that ther e wer en’t incr eases at par ticular points that corr espond with k ey moments in

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t the r esear chers’ claim about the diets of
jaguars in the Br azilian P antanal. The text notes that jaguars gener ally eat land-based mammals, but r esear chers claim that
jaguars in the P antanal can sur vive on a diet that includes mor e ﬁsh and aquatic r eptiles than mammals. Finding that the r emains
of aquatic r eptiles and ﬁsh appear mor e often in these jaguars’ waste than the r emains of mammals do would suppor t the
resear chers’ claim, since it would suggest that ﬁsh and aquatic r eptiles ar e a mor e signiﬁcant par t of the jaguars’ diet than
mammals ar e.
Choice B is incorr ect because ﬁnding that a par ticular aquatic r eptile exists in high numbers in the ar ea would not suppor t the
resear chers’ claim about the jaguars’ diet. The mer e presence of many aquatic r eptiles nearb y does not mean that the jaguars eat
those r eptiles, let alone sur vive on mor e aquatic r eptiles and ﬁsh than mammals. Choice C is incorr ect. Although ﬁnding that
aquatic r eptiles and ﬁsh can pr ovide nutrients that land mammals typically do not pr ovide could help explain why some animals
eat those r eptiles and ﬁsh, it would not indicate whether the jaguars in par ticular eat those r eptiles and ﬁsh and thus would not
suppor t the r esear chers’ claim. Choice D is incorr ect because ﬁnding that when pr eying on mammals, jaguars pr efer semiaquatic
mammals, such as cap ybar as, would be irr elevant t o the r esear chers’ claim that the jaguars can sur vive on a diet of mor e ﬁsh and

Choice C is the best answer because it illustr ates the student’ s claim about some hist orians viewing L umumba primarily as a

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the inﬂuence of decision-making modes
on consumers’ choices of diff erent electricity plans. The Aff ect Mode describes choices based on the decision-mak er’s preferred
emotional outcome, the Role Mode describes choices based on the decision-mak er’s social motiv ations, and the Calculation Mode
describes choices based on minimizing ﬁnancial costs and maximizing the decision-mak er’s conv enience. Thus, if those using a
Calculation Mode disfa vor the gr een plan, it would be due t o some ﬁnancial or conv enience bur den the gr een plan imposes that
the other doesn ’t. The text indicates that the gr een plan had a lower ﬁnancial cost but was nonetheless r ejected b y par ticipants
using the Calculation Mode. It ther efore follows that the gr een plan lik ely imposed a conv enience bur den that outweighed potential

have remained insigniﬁcant wer e it not for V enezuelan r evolutionar y Francisco de Mir anda, who was handed the unpublished letter
after Viscar do’s death. Mir anda not only helped cir culate the letter , but his edits and footnotes t o the text position Mir anda as a
centr al ﬁgur e in the text’ s creation.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. The original authorship of “Letter t o the Spanish Americans” is disputed b y contempor ary hist orians.
B. The majority of the most eloquently stated ar guments in “Letter t o the Spanish Americans” wer e written b y Mir anda.
C. Miranda pla yed a crucial r ole in inﬂuencing the content and distribution of “Letter t o the Spanish Americans. ”

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The text describes how Mir anda cir culated, edited, and added footnotes t o “Letter t o the Spanish
Americans, ” and it claims that the letter and its author would ha ve “remained insigniﬁcant” if it wer en’t for Mir anda ’s effor ts.
Choice A is incorr ect. The text only sa ys that Viscar do wr ote the letter and that Mir anda edited it: it ne ver suggests that the original
authorship of the letter is up for debate. Choice B is incorr ect. This contr adicts the text. The text sa ys that Mir anda edited and
footnoted the letter , but it identiﬁes Viscar do as the letter ’s author . It also ne ver identiﬁes cer tain ar guments as mor e eloquent
than others. Choice D is incorr ect. This is outside the scope of the text. The par agraph describes Mir anda ’s role in the cr eation and
distribution of the letter , but it doesn ’t get int o the eff ects of the letter on other people.

ID: cef77aa7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Johny Isla and the whalelik e geoglyph.
The text indicates that the German exhibit about the Naz ca Lines included a phot ograph showing a whalelik e geoglyph that Isla
hadn ’t known about befor e attending the exhibit, e ven though Isla “ specializ es in ” Naz ca Lines geoglyphs. Giv en his exper tise, and
his surprise at being unfamiliar with the whale glyph, the text str ongly suggests that Isla belie ved he would ha ve noticed the glyph
if he had been t o its location. Thus, the text implies that the whalelik e geoglyph is lik ely in a location Isla had not pr eviously been
to.   
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess either the species of whale that the geoglyph is meant t o represent or its
relationship t o the earliest humans in the ar ea that is now P eru. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that the
phot ograph of the whalelik e geoglyph was on displa y at a “German exhibit, ” that exhibit was speciﬁcally “ about the Naz ca Lines, ”
which the text indicates ar e located in P eru. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text does indicate that the glyphs wer e created

ID: 9c591ff7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of A.
mexicanus . Accor ding t o the text, A. mexicanus , a riv er-dwelling ﬁsh species, has coloniz ed ca ves. The ﬁsh that liv e in riv ers and
those that liv e in ca ves show no signiﬁcant genetic diff erences and ar e all capable of making the same sounds. The text indicates,
howe ver, that Hy acinthe and colleagues found that sounds that the riv er ﬁsh use in a par ticular context and for a par ticular
purpose ar e used in a diff erent context and for a diff erent purpose b y the ca ve ﬁsh. Additionally , the sounds made b y cave ﬁsh
show some diff erences depending on the speciﬁc ca ve the ﬁsh inhabit. The text goes on t o state that Hy acinthe and colleagues
have noted that diff erences in how the ﬁsh use sound t o communicate could e ventually become so gr eat that the y prevent ﬁsh
from diff erent locations fr om interbr eeding. In other wor ds, the riv er ﬁsh might e ventually only br eed with other riv er ﬁsh (with
whom the y shar e char acteristics r egar ding sonic communication that the y do not shar e with ca ve ﬁsh), while the ca ve ﬁsh might
only br eed with other ca ve ﬁsh for a similar r eason. In context, this obser vation suggests that e ven though the ﬁsh ar e a single
species right now , they could be in the pr ocess of splitting int o distinct populations with diff erent char acteristics. 
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e is no information in the text suggesting that the riv er ﬁsh ar e less r eliant on sonic
communication than the ca ve ﬁsh ar e. Although the text does indicate that the riv er ﬁsh and ca ve ﬁsh ar e genetically similar , the
text describes both gr oups as using sonic communication and sa ys nothing t o indicate that one gr oup depends on that
communication mor e than the other gr oup does. Choice C is incorr ect. The text states that all members of the species can emit
the same sounds but that the function and context of sounds diff er depending on whether the ﬁsh liv e in riv ers or ca ves, but it
does not indicate that riv er ﬁsh pr oduce sounds that ca ve ﬁsh do not or vice v ersa. Choice D is incorr ect because it contr adicts the
text. The text sa ys that ther e is little genetic diff erence between the riv er ﬁsh and the ca ve ﬁsh, not that the riv er ﬁsh and ca ve ﬁsh
are so genetically distinct that the y can be consider ed separ ate species.

Psychologists Dacher K eltner and Jonathan Haidt ha ve argued that experiencing awe—a sensation of r everence and wonder
typically br ought on b y per ceiving something gr and or power ful—can enable us t o feel mor e connected t o others and ther eby
inspir e us t o act mor e altruistically . Keltner , along with P aul K. Piff, Pia Dietz e, and colleagues, claims t o ha ve found e vidence for
this eff ect in a r ecent study wher e par ticipants wer e ask ed to either gaz e up at ex ceptionally tall tr ees in a nearb y grove (repor ted

Which ﬁnding fr om the r esear chers’ study , if true, would most str ongly suppor t their claim?
A. Participants who had been looking at the tr ees helped the experimenter pick up signiﬁcantly mor e pens than did par ticipants

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most str ongly suppor t the r esear chers’ claim that the y
found e vidence that experiencing awe can mak e people f eel mor e connected t o others and thus mor e likely to beha ve altruistically
(with beneﬁcial and unselﬁsh concern for others). Accor ding t o the text, the r esear chers tested for this eff ect b y ﬁrst ha ving

more pens than did par ticipants who had look ed at the building would suppor t the r esear chers’ claim b y demonstr ating that the
people who had experienced awe beha ved mor e altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other par ticipants did.
Choice B is incorr ect because a ﬁnding about helpful par ticipants using positiv e wor ds to describe the tr ees and the building after
the experiment was o ver wouldn ’t ha ve any bearing on the r esear chers’ claim that experiencing awe incr eases altruistic beha vior.
The text doesn ’t addr ess the use of positiv e wor ds to describe things or suggest any connection between using such wor ds and
having experienced awe, so that beha vior wouldn ’t ser ve as e vidence that experiencing awe pla yed a r ole in pr omoting helpful
beha vior. Choice C is incorr ect because a ﬁnding that par ticipants who didn ’t help the experimenter wer e signiﬁcantly mor e likely

claim that experiencing awe incr eases altruistic beha vior b y suggesting that the opposite might be true—that experiencing awe is

participants noticing that the experimenter had dr opped the pens wouldn ’t ha ve any bearing on the r esear chers’ claim about
people beha ving altruistically . Being awar e of a challenge or pr oblem isn ’t necessarily beneﬁcial on its own and isn ’t the same as

ID: fd1095d7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of silicon carbide (SiC ) ﬁbers and cr eep, or
deformation r elated t o ongoing mechanical str ess and ele vated temper atures. The text states that Bhatt et al. found that a
nitrogen-tr eated SiC ﬁber had a lower minimum cr eep r ate than two polymer-deriv ed SiC ﬁbers did. Because ha ving a lower cr eep
rate means that the material is slower t o deform with exposur e to str ess, as the text explains, this ﬁnding suggests that aer ospace
composites made with the nitr ogen-tr eated SiC ﬁber ma y be able t o withstand mechanical str ess for a longer period than those
made with the other two polymer-deriv ed SiC ﬁbers can.
Choice A is incorr ect because it o verstates the implications of the study ’s ﬁndings, which ha ve to do with the r ate of a material’ s
deformation under str ess, not the absolute degr ee of deformation. The text states that Bhatt et al. obser ved that a nitr ogen-tr eated
SiC ﬁber had a lower minimum cr eep r ate than two polymer-deriv ed SiC ﬁbers did, meaning only that it deformed mor e slowly o ver
time under constant str ess, not that it under went less deformation o verall. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t establish
any similarity between the two polymer-deriv ed SiC ﬁbers other than that both had a higher cr eep r ate than the nitr ogen-tr eated
SiC ﬁber did in Bhatt et al. ’s study . Mor eover, reducing a material’ s resistance t o creep would mean that the material becomes
more susceptible t o deformation with exposur e to str ess and ele vated temper atures, which would be expected t o shor ten r ather
than pr olong the lif espan of machiner y made with that material. Choice C is incorr ect because the text suggests that the stability
of aer ospace equipment ma y be better impr oved b y composites containing nitr ogen-tr eated SiC ﬁber than b y composites
containing the two polymer-deriv ed SiC ﬁbers, not the other wa y around. The text indicates that Bhatt et al. obser ved that the
nitrogen-tr eated SiC ﬁber had a lower minimum cr eep r ate than the other two ﬁbers did, meaning that it was slower t o degr ade

Choice D is the best answer because it best describes data in the gr aph suppor ting A yalew and her colleagues’ hypothesis that
plants’ r esponse t o kanamy cin exposur e inv olves altering their uptak e of metals. The gr aph compar es the metal content of two
groups of plants, one with kanamy cin exposur e and a contr ol gr oup without such exposur e. The amount of zinc in plants without
kanamy cin exposur e is ar ound 400 par ts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamy cin exposur e is lower , at
around 300 par ts per million. Similarly , the amount of ir on in plants without kanamy cin exposur e is a little o ver 600 par ts per
million, while the amount of ir on in plants with kanamy cin exposur e is lower , at a little o ver 200 par ts per million. Thus, the gr aph
shows that plants with kanamy cin exposur e ha ve signiﬁcantly lower le vels of both ir on and zinc than the plants without kanamy cin
exposur e. This is e vidence suppor ting the hypothesis that kanamy cin exposur e results in plants altering their uptak e of metals.
Choice A is incorr ect because the gr aph shows that contr ol plants contained higher le vels of ir on than zinc, not higher le vels of
zinc than ir on; similarly , the plants exposed t o kanamy cin contained higher le vels of zinc than ir on, not higher le vels of ir on than
zinc. Choice B is incorr ect. Though the claim that both gr oups of plants contained mor e than 200 par ts per million of both ir on and
zinc is suppor ted b y the gr aph, this alone does not state whether plants with kanamy cin exposur e ha ve a diff erent metal content

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the ﬁnding that, if true, would most str ongly suppor t the r esear ch team ’s idea
about the eff ect of iridescence, or colors that appear t o shimmer and change. The text indicates that although some scientists
have assumed that iridescence could attr act pr edat ors, Kjernsmo ’s team wonder ed if iridescent insects might be har der for other
animals t o see. The team tested this idea b y asking human par ticipants t o look for both iridescent beetle wings and beetle wings
that wer en’t iridescent but that had been painted colors such as purple or blue. If par ticipants located most of the purple or blue
wings but far f ewer of the iridescent wings, that ﬁnding would suppor t the team ’s idea since it would suggest that noniridescent
wings ar e easier t o see than iridescent wings.
Choice B is incorr ect because if par ticipants located the iridescent wings mor e quickly than the purple or blue wings, that ﬁnding
would weak en the team ’s idea, not suppor t the team ’s idea, since it would suggest that the iridescent wings wer e easier t o see
than the noniridescent wings. Choice C is incorr ect because ﬁnding that some par ticipants belie ved that the purple wings wer e
easier t o see than the blue wings would be irr elevant t o the team ’s idea. The purple and blue wings wer e both noniridescent, so any
difference in how easy those two colors wer e to see would ha ve nothing t o do with the idea that iridescent insects ar e har der t o
see than noniridescent insects. Choice D is incorr ect because if some par ticipants found all the wings, that wouldn ’t suppor t the
team ’s idea that iridescent insects ma y be har der t o see than noniridescent insects. If anything, this ﬁnding might weak en the

Many go vernments that r egularly tr ansf er mone y to individuals—t o provide supplemental incomes for senior citiz ens, for example
—ha ve long done so electr onically , but other countries typically ha ve distributed physical mone y and ha ve only r ecently de veloped
electr onic tr ansf er infr astructur e. Resear chers studied the intr oduction of an electr onic tr ansf er system in one such location and
found that r ecipients of electr onic tr ansf ers consumed a diff erent arr ay of foods than r ecipients of physical tr ansf ers of the same
amount did. One potential explanation for this r esult is that individuals conceiv e of and allocate funds in physical mone y
differently than the y conceiv e of and allocate funds in electr onic form. 
Which ﬁnding fr om the study , if true, would most dir ectly weak en the potential explanation?
A. Recipients of electr onic tr ansf ers typically spent their funds at a slower r ate than r ecipients of physical tr ansf ers did. 
B. Nearly e very recipient of an electr onic tr ansf er withdr ew the entir e amount in physical mone y shor tly after r eceiving the

C. Recipients of physical tr ansf ers tended t o pur chase food about as fr equently as r ecipients of electr onic tr ansf ers did. 
D. Some r ecipients of physical tr ansf ers r eceiv ed small amounts of mone y relativ ely fr equently , while others r eceiv ed lar ge
amounts r elativ ely infr equently .
ID: 156ff681  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . This would weak en the explanation. If the r ecipients of electr onic mone y immediately withdr ew it all
as physical mone y, then both kinds of r ecipients ended up spending physical mone y on food. So ther e must be some other
explanation why those who initially r eceiv ed electr onic mone y ate diff erent kinds of food.
Choice A is incorr ect. This wouldn ’t weak en the explanation. If anything, it actually suppor ts it: it demonstr ates that r ecipients of
electr onic mone y and r ecipients of physical mone y have diff erent spending habits. Choice C is incorr ect. This wouldn ’t weak en the
explanation. The explanation we ’re testing this choice against is about the wa y that people might “ conceiv e of and allocate ”
physical and electr onic funds diff erently . This choice only focuses on the timing, not what the y spend the mone y on. Choice D is
incorr ect. This would ha ve no impact on the explanation. It doesn ’t tell us anything about possible diff erences between the
spending habits of those who spend physical mone y and those who spend mone y electr onically .

Iceber gs gener ally appear t o be mostly white or blue, depending on how the ice r eﬂects sunlight. Ice with air bubbles tr apped in it
looks white because much of the light r eﬂects off the bubbles. Ice without air bubbles usually looks blue because the light tr avels
deep int o the ice and only a little of it is r eﬂected. Howe ver, some iceber gs in the sea ar ound Antar ctica appear t o be gr een. One

Which ﬁnding, if true, would most dir ectly weak en the team ’s hypothesis?
A. White ice doesn ’t change color when mix ed with dissolv ed or ganic carbon due t o the air bubbles in the ice.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would weak en the scientists’ hypothesis about iceber gs that

Antar ctica appear t o be gr een. The text goes on t o sa y that the scientists hypothesiz ed that this gr een color occurs when y ellow-
tinted dissolv ed or ganic carbon in ocean waters mix es with blue ice. A ﬁnding that both blue iceber gs and gr een iceber gs contain
similarly small tr aces of dissolv ed or ganic carbon would suggest that something other than y ellow-tinted or ganic carbon causes
some iceber gs’ gr een color , since the blue iceber gs that contain y ellow-tinted or ganic carbon r emained blue instead of turning
green.
Choice A is incorr ect because, accor ding t o the text, the scientists’ hypothesis was that blue iceber gs, not white ones, change
color when their ice mix es with y ellow-tinted dissolv ed or ganic carbon. A ﬁnding that white ice, because of its air bubbles, doesn ’t
change color when it’ s mix ed with dissolv ed or ganic carbon would ther efore ha ve no bearing on the scientists’ hypothesis. Choice
B is incorr ect because the text focuses only on Antar ctic iceber gs that appear t o be gr een. It doesn ’t indicate that iceber gs in
locations other than Antar ctica ha ve been found t o ha ve a gr een hue. A ﬁnding that dissolv ed or ganic carbon has a str onger

ID: e1504a2a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the Cr etaceous pter osaur Tupandactylus
navigans . The text ﬁrst describes what paleont ologists initially speculated t o be true of T. navigans  based on obser ving only
fossiliz ed skulls of the pter osaur r ather than complete sk eletons—namely , that T. navigans  had an o versiz ed head cr est and that,
like other pter osaurs, its main mode of mo vement must ha ve been ﬂight. The text goes on t o describe what r esear cher Vict or
Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossiliz ed sk eleton of T. navigans , which pr ovided additional
information that fossiliz ed skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that T. navigans  had long hind legs, shor t
wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition t o the o versiz ed head cr est pr eviously obser ved b y paleont ologists. Taken together ,
these char acteristics would ha ve made sustained ﬂight diﬃcult and upright walking comfor table, which would mak e T. navigans
different fr om other pter osaurs that mo ved mainly thr ough ﬂight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that pr eviously held
speculations of paleont ologists ar e inaccur ate: that instead of mo ving mainly thr ough power ed ﬂight, T. navigans  likely ﬂew for
shor ter distances and spent mor e time walking than r esear chers pr eviously thought.
Choice A is incorr ect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete sk eleton, that T.
navigans  would ha ve found " sustained ﬂight diﬃcult, " which would diff erentiate it fr om most other pter osaurs that mo ved mainly
through ﬂight. Ther efore, Beccari’ s team would not suggest that T. navigans  ﬂew for longer distances than did other pter osaur
species with lar ge head cr ests. Choice B is incorr ect because the fossiliz ed sk eleton studied b y Beccari and colleagues was
notable for its shor t wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pter osaurs wer e thought b y paleont ologists t o
be comfor table walking. Ther efore, Beccari’ s team would not suggest that T. navigans  had longer wings than other pter osaur
species consider ed to ha ve been comfor table walking. Choice C is incorr ect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team
agree with the paleont ologists mentioned earlier in the text that T. navigans had a lar ge-cr ested head. Ther efore, Beccari’ s team
would not suggest that T. navigans  had a smaller head than r esear chers pr eviously expected.

Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the quotation that best suppor ts the student’ s claim about Br aschi. By describing

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about Hans Cast orp’s story that is suggested b y the text. The
narrator of the text indicates that the st ory about Hans Cast orp will be t old not because ther e is something par ticularly notable
about him, since he is pleasant but " perfectly or dinar y," but because the st ory itself is r emarkable ("v ery much wor th telling"). The
narrator then notes that ther e is a beneﬁt in being at the hear t of the st ory—that it is "in Hans Cast orp’s favor" that the st ory is his,
and ma ybe uniquely so (" not e very story happens t o everybody "). Thus, the text suggests both that the st ory that will be t old is a
remarkable one that happened t o an unr emarkable person and that it is r easonable t o argue that the person at the center of a
valuable st ory tak es on some of the st ory’s value.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the narr ator of the text mak es the point that " not e very story happens t o everybody ," the narr ator
doesn ’t state that st ories ar e inter esting simply because the people the y are about ar e unique. Rather , the narr ator suggests that
one par ticular st ory is "v ery much wor th telling" on its own and that Hans Cast orp beneﬁts fr om the fact that the st ory is

The ancient writing system used in the Ma ya kingdoms of southern Mexico and Centr al America had a symbol for the number
zero. The earliest known example of the symbol dates t o mor e than 2,000 y ears ago. A t that time, almost none of the writing
systems elsewher e in the world possessed a z ero symbol. And the use of z ero in Mexico and Centr al America ma y be e ven mor e
ancient. Some hist orians suggest that Ma ya mathematicians inherited it fr om the Olmec civilization, which ﬂourished in the r egion
2,400–3,600 y ears ago.
Accor ding t o the text, what do some hist orians suggest about Ma ya civilization?
A. Maya civilization acquir ed the use of z ero from the Olmec civilization.
B. Maya civilization r espected its hist orians mor e than it r espected its mathematicians.

D. Maya civilization tried t o intr oduce its writing system t o other civilizations.
ID: 9fe7aafa  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents information about Ma ya civilization that is suppor ted b y the text. The text states
that the writing system used in the Ma ya kingdoms had a symbol for the number z ero. It goes on t o sa y that at the time of the z ero
symbol’ s earliest example, mor e than 2,000 y ears ago, almost no other writing systems in the world f eatur ed such a symbol. The
text also points out that some hist orians suggest that Ma ya mathematicians inherited the use of z ero from the Olmec civilization,
which existed in the same ar ea as the Ma ya civilization at an earlier date. Thus, accor ding t o the text, some hist orians suggest that
the Ma ya civilization acquir ed the use of z ero from the Olmec civilization.
Choice B is incorr ect because although the text mentions pr esent-da y hist orians and Ma ya mathematicians, it does not sa y
anything about how much the Ma ya civilization r espected its hist orians and mathematicians. Choice C is incorr ect because the
text does not indicate that the Ma ya civilization tr eated its use of the z ero symbol, or any other intellectual achie vements, as
secr ets t o be k ept fr om other civilizations. Choice D is incorr ect because although the text mentions hist orians who suggest that
the writing system of the Ma ya civilization inherited some f eatur es fr om the earlier Olmec civilization, the text does not describe
any attempts of Ma ya civilization t o intr oduce its writing system t o other civilizations.

Barchester Towers  is an 1857 no vel by Anthony Trollope. In the no vel, Trollope ’s por trayal of Dr . Proudie underscor es the

A. “It must not…be tak en as pr oved that Dr . Proudie was a man of gr eat mental powers, or e ven of much capacity for business, for

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . In this quotation, Dr . Proudie is described as "fondly ﬂatter[ing] himself " that he has gifts that " must
be sur e to recommend him t o a y et higher notice. " In other wor ds, he expects his skills t o push him t o greater fame and success.
This implies an exagger ated sense of his own abilities, which matches the claim we ’re trying t o suppor t.
Choice A is incorr ect. This quotation doesn ’t describe Pr oudie ’s view of himself, nor does it paint him in an especially ﬂattering
light. Instead, b y saying his mental powers and business skill ar e not " proved," it implies that he is actually dim-witted and bad at
business. Choice C is incorr ect. This choice describes Pr oudie ’s closeness t o power and impor tance, but it doesn ’t show what
Proudie thinks of himself. Pr oudie is not describing himself or his abilities her e. The narr ator is. Choice D is incorr ect. While this
quotation off ers Pr oudie v ery mild pr aise, it doesn ’t show what Pr oudie thinks of himself or his own abilities, which is what the

For its 1974 work Instant Mur al, the Chicano ar t collectiv e Asco taped members P atssi V aldez and Humber to Sando val to an

ID: 4b8eda0a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Instant Mur al. Accor ding t o the text, the
1974 work Instant Mur al involved taping two Asco members (P atssi V aldez and Humber to Sando val) to an outdoor wall as a dir ect
commentar y on constr aint (limitation or r estriction). The text suggests that instead of focusing on V aldez’ s role in the work and on
social limitations women faced at the time—an appr oach that fails t o explain the r ole of Sando val, a man—people should consider
that in 1974 (and long befor e) the ar t establishment limited r ecognition of Chicano ar tists t o those who cr eated mur als with social
and hist orical subjects, making it challenging for nonmur alist Chicano ar tists (such as Asco ’s members) t o show their work. The
text suggests that considering the situation with the ar t establishment leads t o a conclusion that accounts for the fact that Instant
Mural is explicitly about constr aint and f eatur es both a woman and a man taped t o the wall: Instant Mur al isn’t a r eﬂection of the
social constr aints placed on women speciﬁcally but instead is a r eﬂection on the constr aining aesthetic expectations placed on
Chicano ar tists in gener al (that is, the limits r esulting fr om the lack of r ecognition of Chicano ar tists of any gender who did not
create sociohist orical mur als).
Choice A is incorr ect. The text indicates that the ar t establishment in 1974 (and earlier) did r ecogniz e Chicano mur alists t o the
exclusion of other Chicano ar tists, so ther e’s no r eason t o assume Asco ’s work Instant Mur al was intended t o represent Chicano
muralists’ frustr ation; it’ s far mor e likely that Asco ’s members—described as Chicano nonmur alists—wer e representing their own
frustr ation at being unr ecogniz ed b y the ar t establishment. Choice B is incorr ect. The text emphasiz es that while a common
appr oach t o Instant Mur al focuses on V aldez and the social limitations women faced in 1974 but fails t o account for the pr esence
of a man in the work, ther e is a conclusion that explains Sando val’s role. But concluding that Instant Mur al represents a double
constr aint experienced speciﬁcally b y female Chicano ar tists would still fail t o account for the inclusion of a man in the work.

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the scholars’ claim about the
boar d game. The text explains that the r emains of a 4,000-y ear-old boar d game wer e found in Oman. The text then states that
scholars claim this boar d game was pla yed mostly b y traders. If the other known examples of this boar d game fr om the same

Choice A is incorr ect because this ﬁnding would suggest only that a single tr ader ma y have possessed examples of the boar d
game, perhaps for the purpose of tr ading or selling the game t o residents of Oman. F or this r eason, the ﬁnding wouldn ’t dir ectly

Choice C is the best answer . The text tells us that lemons—an expensiv e impor ted pr oduct—f eatur e in Dutch paintings of the

infected state. The study ’s resear chers also obser ved that the uninf ected ants ha ve shor ter lif espans than expected. If the inf ected
ants, who ar e doing less work in the colony , have longer lif espans, it can be inf erred that the less an ant works, the longer it will
live. The opposite of this statement can also be inf erred: the mor e an ant works, the shor ter its lif e. So, since the workload within
the colony is being r edistributed so that the inf ected ants work less while the uninf ected ants work mor e (as the y tak e on the
neglected duties of the inf ected ants and also car e for those ants), then it can be inf erred that the lif espans of the uninf ected ants

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t the r esear chers’ pr ediction about the
language nest model of education. The text states that Mor com and Ro y studied the eff ects of the language nest model of
education on students at an Anishinaabe school, and the y found that the model—which is used with students during pr e-K or
elementar y school—incr eased students’ ﬂuency in the Anishinaabe language and pride in Anishinaabe cultur e. The r esear chers
predicted that the students’ positiv e early experiences with the Anishinaabe language would lead them t o be mor e likely to later
shar e the language with y ounger gener ations. If former students maintain full ﬂuency and cultur al pride after ﬁnishing secondar y
and higher education, it follows that the y would be both able and motiv ated t o shar e what the y know with others; this would lik ely
result in a higher pr obability of tr ansmitting the language t o younger gener ations, as the r esear chers pr edict.
Choice A is incorr ect because ﬁnding that Anishinaabe adults who didn ’t attend the school f eel appr oximately the same degr ee of
cultur al pride as those adults who did attend wouldn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ pr ediction that former students will be mor e likely
to shar e their knowledge with y ounger gener ations. This ﬁnding would identify a similarity between the gr oups r ather than a fact or
that might mak e former students mor e likely than other adults t o transmit the language t o younger people. Choice B is incorr ect
because ﬁnding that new students experience incr eased per formance in language ﬂuency and academics would suggest that the
school has a positiv e eff ect on students when the y attended but wouldn ’t reveal anything about those students’ later actions as
adults (such as their lik elihood of sharing their knowledge with y ounger gener ations). Choice C is incorr ect because ﬁnding that
Anishinaabe adults who attended the school ar e equally lik ely to sta y in the community as adults who didn ’t attend the school
wouldn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ pr ediction that former students will be mor e likely to shar e their knowledge with y ounger

Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents the quotation that best illustr ates the claim that the speak er is determined t o
experience the countr yside ar ound her . In the quotation, the speak er mak es it clear that she plans t o walk somewher e based on
her own wishes (“ wher e my own natur e would be leading”) r ather than follow anything else (“ another guide ”), and that she ’ll walk
“in ferny glens” alongside the mountain. 
Choice A is incorr ect because this quotation suggests that the speak er wants t o avoid pursuing mone y and education (“busy
chase of wealth and learning”) and instead r eturn t o some earlier inter ests (her “ﬁrst f eelings”); the quotation doesn ’t addr ess her
determination t o experience the countr yside. Choice B is incorr ect because the speak er is describing the cir cumstances under
which she won ’t walk, which doesn ’t addr ess her determination t o experience the countr yside. Choice D is incorr ect because
rather than conv eying her determination t o experience the countr yside, the speak er is explaining a par ticular thing she won ’t do
(“seek not the shadowy r egion ”).

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it details a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis about
ad recall. Accor ding t o the text, the r esear chers found that commenting on an ad that appears as a social media post is mor e

Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text compar es one form of social media user inter action with ads—clicking on the ad’ s "lik e"

When digging for clams, their primar y food, sea otters damage the r oots of eelgr ass plants gr owing on the seaﬂoor . Near
Vancouv er Island in Canada, the otter population is lar ge and well established, y et the eelgr ass meadows ar e healthier than those
found elsewher e off Canada ’s coast. To explain this, conser vation scientist Erin F oster and colleagues compar ed the V ancouv er
Island meadows t o meadows wher e otters ar e absent or wer e reintr oduced only r ecently . Finding that the V ancouv er Island
meadows ha ve a mor e div erse gene pool than the others do, F oster hypothesiz ed that damage t o eelgr ass r oots incr eases the

ID: 8584f3ce  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would weak en F oster ’s hypothesis that damage t o eelgr ass
roots impr oves the health of eelgr ass meadows b y boosting genetic div ersity . The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgr ass
roots but that eelgr ass meadows near V ancouv er Island, wher e ther e’s a lar ge otter population, ar e compar atively healthy . When
Foster and her colleagues compar ed the V ancouv er Island eelgr ass meadows t o those that don ’t ha ve established otter
populations, the r esear chers found that the V ancouv er Island meadows ar e mor e genetically div erse than the other meadows ar e.
This ﬁnding led F oster t o hypothesiz e that damage t o the eelgr ass r oots encour ages eelgr ass r eproduction, ther eby impr oving
genetic div ersity and the health of the meadows. If, howe ver, other meadows not included in the study ar e less healthy the lar ger
the local otter population is and the longer the otters ha ve been in r esidence, that would suggest that damage t o the eelgr ass
roots, which would be expected t o incr ease with the siz e and r esidential dur ation of the otter population, isn ’t leading meadows t o
be healthier . Such a ﬁnding would ther efore weak en F oster ’s hypothesis.
Choice A is incorr ect because ﬁnding that small, r ecently intr oduced otter populations ar e near other eelgr ass meadows in the
study wouldn ’t weak en F oster ’s hypothesis. If otter populations wer e small and only r ecently established, the y wouldn ’t be
expected t o ha ve caused much damage t o eelgr ass r oots, so e ven if those eelgr ass meadows wer e less healthy than the
Vancouv er Island meadows, that wouldn ’t undermine F oster ’s hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with F oster ’s hypothesis
since it would suggest that the gr eater damage caused b y larger, mor e established otter populations is associated with healthier
meadows. Choice B is incorr ect because the existence of ar eas with otters but without eelgr ass meadows wouldn ’t reveal
anything about whether the damage that otters cause t o eelgr ass r oots ultimately beneﬁts eelgr ass meadows. Choice D is
incorr ect because the health of plants other than eelgr ass would ha ve no bearing on F oster ’s hypothesis that damage t o eelgr ass
roots leads t o greater genetic div ersity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters t o ha ve a negativ e eff ect on other
plants while ne vertheless impr oving the health of eelgr ass meadows b y damaging eelgr ass r oots.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the gr aph t o complete the student’ s conclusion about
beehiv e structur e. The text explains that in the hiv es of hone ybees, the hexagonal cells housing dr one eggs ar e lar ger than the
hexagonal cells housing work er eggs, and that this siz e diff erence r esults in a construction pr oblem that the bees addr ess b y
using nonhexagonal cells t o ﬁll gaps between sections of dr one-egg cells and work er-egg cells. The text also states that the siz e
difference between dr one-egg cells and work er-egg cells v aries b y species of hone ybee. The gr aph displa ys data on the
percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hiv es of thr ee species. In the hiv es of the western hone ybee, the per centages of ﬁv e-
sided, se ven-sided, and eight-sided cells ar e all less than 0.5%. But in the hiv es of the black dwar f hone ybee, the per centages of
ﬁve-sided and se ven-sided cells ar e higher than those for the western hone ybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwar f hone ybee,
the per centages of ﬁv e-sided and se ven-sided cells ar e also higher than those for the western hone ybee: slightly o ver 2.5% and
slightly o ver 2.0%, r espectiv ely; additionally , the dwar f hone ybee possesses a higher per centage of eight-sided cells than the
western hone ybee does. Taken alt ogether , the gr aph shows that the hiv es of the western hone ybee consist of a smaller
percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hiv es of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only t o solv e the
construction pr oblem arising fr om the diff erence in siz e between dr one-egg cells and work er-egg cells, a smaller per centage of
nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller siz e diff erence between the two types of cells. Ther efore, it can be
concluded fr om the data that work er-egg cells ar e probably closer in siz e to drone-egg cells in the hiv es of the western hone ybee
than in the hiv es of the other two species.
Choice B is incorr ect because, as the text states, hone ybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal
ones. Thus, the western hone ybee and black dwar f hone ybee wouldn ’t deposit dr one eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwar f
hone ybee wouldn ’t deposit dr one eggs in se ven-sided cells. Choice C is incorr ect. The text explains that hone ybees r ely mainly on
one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hiv es, and the gr aph shows that the western hone ybee r elies on the
same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwar f hone ybee does: ﬁv e-sided, se ven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other wor ds, the
western hone ybee and dwar f hone ybee r ely on the same number of geometric shapes. F or the black dwar f hone ybee, the gr aph
displa ys data only for ﬁv e-sided and se ven-sided cells, which suggests a t otal absence of eight-sided cells. Y et this would be only
one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western hone ybee. Thus, based on the gr aph, it would be inaccur ate t o sa y that
the western hone ybee r elies on " many mor e" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorr ect. As the text
explains, hone ybee hiv es consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells ar e used t o connect sections of
hexagonal cells of diff erent siz es. Since the gr aph indicates that the per centage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western
hone ybee than it is for the dwar f hone ybee or black dwar f hone ybee, the western hone ybee would conv ersely ha ve a higher
percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwar f hone ybee or black dwar f hone ybee does, not a lower per centage.

ID: c95995bc  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it is the choice that most logically completes the text. The text mentions a dialect of Spanish
spok en in New Mexico, which was coloniz ed b y Spain in the 1600s. The text then states that the New Mexican dialect diff ers
greatly fr om other Spanish dialects in that it still has char acteristics of an older Spanish that other dialects e ventually lost. After
asking why this might be, the text points out that the New Mexico colony was distant fr om Spain ’s other colonies, making it less
attractiv e to colonists after the initial colonization. This geogr aphic isolation limited the colony ’s exposur e to other Spanish
colonists who would ha ve other wise intr oduced the changes t o the Spanish language that occurr ed in their r espectiv e colonies. It
can ther efore be inf erred that this isolation is a r eason why the New Mexican dialect still has char acteristics of an older Spanish,
while the Spanish dialects spok en in less isolated ar eas that ha ve mor e inter action with speak ers of other dialects would lose
those char acteristics o ver time. Thus, the most logical completion of the text is that geogr aphical isolation can inﬂuence how a
language de velops.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text discusses diff erent dialects of Spanish, not diff erent languages alt ogether . Choice B is
incorr ect because the text focuses on how the New Mexican dialect has sta yed the same o ver time in some wa ys, not on how it
has changed fr om one gener ation t o the next. Choice D is incorr ect because though the text discusses how the New Mexican
dialect of Spanish is diff erent fr om others, it does not discuss how speak ers of diff erent dialects ar e able t o understand each

Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. Accor ding t o the text, Gr oss and Altman ’s

Choice A is incorr ect. While the goal of the book’ s creators (pr oviding a compr ehensiv e hist ory of the Star Trek franchise) could be

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that Rosenswig, López-
Torrijos, and colleagues concluded that ther e is a cultur al link between the city of Izapa and the 41 smaller settlements the y

that r esear chers ha ve inf erred that Izapa was r elated t o the smaller settlements that surr ounded it based in par t on the similarity

Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text discusses a similarity between how structur es in Izapa and nearb y settlements ar e

D. begin de veloping mor e ears of corn on each plant than the tallest v ariety of corn curr ently does.
ID: 4025e00c  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’ s discussion about a tr ade-
off in gr owing shor ter v arieties of corn. The text explains that plant specialists ar e working t o de velop shor ter corn v arieties in an
effor t to impr ove yields. The text points out that although gr eater height in corn plants can lead t o mor e ears of corn per plant, it
also mak es the stalks mor e likely to be damaged b y str ong winds befor e ther e is a chance t o har vest the corn. This pr esents a
clear tr ade-off between potential yield (taller plants pr oducing mor e ears per plant) and har vest r eliability (shor ter plants sur viving
until har vest time). Giv en this information, it is r easonable t o inf er that shor ter corn v arieties, while possibly pr oducing f ewer ears
per plant, would be mor e likely to sur vive until har vest time. This sur vival adv antage would r esult in impr oved yields of har vested
corn because mor e plants would r emain intact, thus offsetting the potential r eduction in ears per shor ter plant.
Choice B is incorr ect. Accor ding t o the text, gr eater height mak es cornstalks vulner able t o snapping or being upr ooted in str ong
winds, implying that taller plants—not shor ter ones—ha ve greater stability pr oblems. The text pr ovides no basis for inf erring that
shor ter corn v arieties would be mor e likely to be upr ooted due t o corn weight; in fact, the text suggests the opposite r elationship
between height and stability . Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t provide information about the land r equir ements of
either shor ter corn v arieties or shor ter wheat and rice v arieties, much less mak e any comparisons. The text mentions that plant
breeders in the 1950s and ’60s cr eated shor ter v arieties of wheat and rice with impr oved yields and that r esear chers ar e now
exploring shor ter corn v arieties, but it doesn ’t compar e land-use r equir ements of these cr ops. Choice D is incorr ect because the
idea that shor ter cornstalks would yield mor e ears of corn would contr adict the r elationship between height and corn pr oduction
described in the text. The text explicitly states that gr eater height allows individual plants t o produce mor e ears of corn, which
suggests that shor ter v arieties would pr oduce f ewer ears per plant, not mor e. The text ther efore provides no basis for concluding
that shor ter v arieties would begin de veloping mor e ears than the taller v arieties curr ently do.

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of ar tifacts and K uulo Kataa ’s founding
date. If it wer e true both that K uulo Kataa was founded in the four teenth centur y CE and that ar tifacts found in ex cavations of the

Choice A is incorr ect because the existence of thir teenth-centur y CE ar tifacts r ecovered during ex cavations of a settlement
founded in the four teenth centur y CE isn ’t logically connected t o artifacts fr om one centur y being mor e commonly r ecovered than

at a site dated t o the four teenth centur y CE doesn ’t imply that four teenth-centur y objects wer e damaged during ex cavations.
Ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that any objects wer e damaged; r ather , the existence of ar tifacts conﬁrmed as pr edating the

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the r elationship between Indigenous
languages and knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants. The text states that Indigenous cultur es possess special knowledge of
the medicinal uses of plants, which is r eﬂected in their v ocabular y. The text then discusses how tribal nations ar e working t o

Indigenous communities. Giv en that the languages of tribal nations in what is now the United States function as r eposit ories of
knowledge about plants’ medicinal uses, it logically follows that continued use of those languages will assist with passing on
knowledge about the medicinal v alue of plants nativ e to the tribal nations’ lands.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text states that pr eser ving Indigenous languages will incr ease the knowledge, not the number , of

When the Vinland Map, a map of the world purpor ted t o date t o the mid-1400s, sur faced in 1957, some scholars belie ved it
demonstr ated that E uropean knowledge of the eastern coast of pr esent-da y Nor th America pr edated Christ opher Columbus’ s
1492 arriv al. In 2021, a team including conser vators Marie-F rance Lema y and P aula Z yats and materials scientist Anikó Bezur
performed an extensiv e analysis of the map and the ink used. They found that the ink contains titanium dio xide, a compound that
was ﬁrst intr oduced in ink manufacturing in the early 1900s. Ther efore, the team concluded that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. mid-1400s E uropeans could not ha ve known about the eastern coast of pr esent-da y Nor th America.
B. the Vinland Map could not ha ve been dr awn b y mid-1400s mapmak ers. 
C. mapmak ers must ha ve used titanium compounds in their ink in the 1400s.
D. there isn ’t enough information t o determine when the ink was cr eated.
ID: 8fbed1cb  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Lema y, Zyats, and Bezur ’s 2021 analysis
of the Vinland Map. The text indicates that while some scholars ha ve belie ved that the map was dr awn in the mid-1400s, the 2021
analysis showed the pr esence of the compound titanium dio xide in the ink used t o draw the map. The text goes on t o sa y that
titanium dio xide wasn ’t used t o manufactur e ink until the early 1900s, which means that ink containing this compound couldn ’t
have been a vailable t o mapmak ers in the 1400s. Since mapmak ers in the mid-1400s couldn ’t ha ve used ink with titanium dio xide,
it follows that the Vinland Map couldn ’t ha ve been dr awn b y mid-1400s mapmak ers.
Choice A is incorr ect because the 2021 ﬁnding that the ink used t o draw the Vinland Map wasn ’t available until the early 1900s
doesn ’t imply that E uropeans in the mid-1400s couldn ’t ha ve known about the eastern coast of Nor th America. While this ﬁnding
suggests that the map couldn ’t ha ve been cr eated in the mid-1400s, it doesn ’t preclude the possibility that E uropeans ne vertheless
had knowledge—and perhaps e ven dr ew other maps that ar e no longer in existence or ar e yet to be disco vered b y resear chers—of
the eastern coast of pr esent-da y Nor th America as early as the mid-1400s. Choice C is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the
text that suggests that the 2021 disco very of the pr esence of titanium dio xide in the ink used t o draw the Vinland Map caused
Lema y, Zyats, and Bezur t o question or r each a new conclusion about when mapmak ers began using ink containing titanium
compounds. Instead, the text indicates that titanium dio xide wasn ’t used in ink befor e the early 1900s. This knowledge led the
team t o conclude that the map, which was dr awn with ink containing titanium dio xide, couldn ’t ha ve been cr eated in the mid-
1400s. Choice D is incorr ect because although the text doesn ’t indicate that Lema y, Zyats, and Bezur established an exact date for
the cr eation of the ink that was used t o draw the Vinland Map, the text does sa y that titanium dio xide was intr oduced in ink
manufacturing in the early 1900s. This fact pr ovides enough information t o determine that the ink that was used t o draw the map
was cr eated no earlier than the early 1900s. This ﬁnding, in turn, led the team t o conclude that the Vinland Map couldn ’t ha ve been
drawn in the mid-1400s.

Bicycles wer e ﬁrst mass-pr oduced in the late nineteenth centur y thr oughout E urope and Nor th America, allowing individuals
remarkable fr eedom t o travel longer distances quickly and comfor tably . This fr eedom, coupled with the affor dability of the v ehicle,

cycling clubs t o enjo y these newfound activities with others. 
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. The widespr ead adoption of the bicy cle in the late nineteenth centur y provided new oppor tunities for people. 
B. The affor dability of the bicy cle in the late nineteenth centur y made it the pr eferred wa y to travel.
C. The popularity of the bicy cle in the late nineteenth centur y gave rise t o the ﬁrst cy cling clubs.

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The text discusses how the mass pr oduction of bicy cles in the late nineteenth centur y allowed people
to travel longer distances, liv e far ther fr om their workplaces, visit neighboring t owns, and par ticipate in new activities and social
clubs. All of these ar e new oppor tunities that wer e provided b y the widespr ead adoption of the bicy cle.
Choice B is incorr ect. The text ne ver sa ys this. It does sa y that the bicy cle was “ affor dable, ” and that the “fr eedom t o travel longer
distances quickly and comfor tably ” made the bicy cle “ popular ,” but it ne ver sa ys that the bicy cle was mor e popular than any other
way of tr aveling (lik e cars or tr ains or horses). Choice C is incorr ect. This is a detail mentioned in the text, but not the main idea.
Cycling clubs ar e only one of the new oppor tunities that ar ose fr om the popularity of the mass-pr oduced bicy cle. A “ main idea ”
should captur e mor e of the information in the text. Choice D is incorr ect. The text ne ver sa ys this. It doesn ’t mention the saf ety of
the mass-pr oduced bicy cle at all.

D. Lutie is spending time alone in her apar tment because she doesn ’t want t o inter act with her neighbors.
ID: 69d662af  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states what is happening in the text. The narr ator notes that L utie thinks
the str eet looks nice in the light of the sunset. The narr ator goes on t o describe what L utie can see in the str eet: childr en pla ying
ball or tag and girls skipping r ope. Thus, what is happening in the text is that L utie is obser ving the appear ance of the str eet at a
particular time of da y and the e vents occurring on it.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although L utie is obser ving childr en pla ying games on her str eet, the text doesn ’t suggest that she is
anno yed b y the noise of the games. Instead, the text sa ys that L utie thinks the str eet looks nice in the light of the sunset. Choice C
is incorr ect. Although L utie is obser ving childr en pla ying games on her str eet, the text doesn ’t suggest that she is puzzled b y the
rules of the games. Choice D is incorr ect because ther e is no e vidence in the text that L utie doesn ’t want t o inter act with her
neighbors or that she is in her apar tment alone. All the text indicates about L utie is that she is watching the e vents on the str eet
and thinks the str eet looks nice in the light of the sunset.

External shopping cues ar e a type of mark eting that uses ob vious messaging—a displa y featuring a new pr oduct, for example, or a
“buy one, get one fr ee” off er—t o entice consumers t o mak e spontaneous pur chases. In a study , data scientist Sam K. Hui and
colleagues found that this eff ect can also be achie ved with a less ob vious cue: r earranging a st ore’s layout. The r esear chers
explain that tr ying t o ﬁnd items in new locations causes shoppers t o mo ve thr ough mor e of the st ore, exposing them t o mor e
products and incr easing the lik elihood that the y’ll buy an item the y hadn ’t planned on pur chasing.

ID: f2b3b53b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it best suppor ts the r esear chers’ explanation of the r esults of r earranging a st ore’s layout.
Accor ding t o the text, Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that r earranging a st ore’s layout can encour age cust omers t o mak e
spontaneous pur chases. The text states that the r esear chers explain that a change in la yout causes shoppers t o hunt for items’
new locations, which exposes the shoppers t o mor e products and incr eases the lik elihood that the y’ll mak e an unplanned
purchase. This quotation fr om a sur veyed shopper indicates that the shopper spontaneously pur chased a notebook while looking
for cleaning supplies that wer en’t in their usual place. The quotation ther efore suppor ts the r esear chers’ explanation that
rearranging a st ore’s layout can lead shoppers t o mak e unanticipated pur chases.
Choice B is incorr ect because it doesn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ explanation that r earranging a st ore’s layout can lead shoppers t o
mak e unanticipated pur chases. Instead of attributing an unplanned pur chase t o a change in la yout, the quotation notes that the
shopper sear ched for but couldn ’t ﬁnd some items, and as a r esult the shopper pur chased less, not mor e, than what was
anticipated. Choice C is incorr ect because the quotation attributes what was pur chased t o coupons that the shopper r eceiv ed, not
to a new st ore layout. Thus, the quotation doesn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ explanation that r earranging a st ore’s layout can lead
shoppers t o mak e unanticipated pur chases. Choice D is incorr ect because the quotation attributes what was pur chased t o the
size and st ock of the st ore, not t o a new st ore layout. The shopper simply pur chased pr oducts that the shopper wanted in a
particular st ore because other st ores didn ’t carr y those pr oducts, so the quotation doesn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ explanation
that r earranging a st ore’s layout can lead shoppers t o mak e spontaneous pur chases.

The v ariety of species with adaptations t o produce t oxins is matched b y the v ariety of uses of those t oxins: nor thern star gazers,
for example, use t oxins for def ense, wher eas tiger snak es use t oxins for pr edation and sk eleton shrimp use t oxins for intr aspeciﬁc

Escherichia coli , Dumas Gálv ez and colleagues conclude that the par ticular form of v enom pr oduction obser ved in C. gr anosus

ID: 44da37eb  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t Dumas Gálv ez and colleagues’
conclusion that the v enom pr oduced b y the scorpion species Centrur oides gr anosus  helps mitigate, or r educe, risk during f eeding
in addition t o enhancing pr edation success. Accor ding t o the text, Gálv ez and colleagues found that the v enom used b y C.
granosus  both subdues pr ey and inhibits the gr owth of Escherichia coli , a pathogen that, if ingested b y C. gr anosus , would
presumably cause disease unless neutr alized in some wa y. If it wer e true that E. coli  is commonly found in species pr eyed on b y C.
granosus  and, mor eover, can withstand C. gr anosus ’s digestiv e juices after ingestion, this would suggest that C. gr anosus  likely
relies on another mechanism t o neutr alize E. coli  to mak e E. coli -infected pr ey saf e for consumption b y the scorpion species. Giv en
that, as the text states, C. gr anosus ’s venom was found t o inhibit the pathogen ’s growth, it ther efore follows that the v enom
provides pr otection for C. gr anosus  against E. coli  that its digestiv e system wouldn ’t other wise pr ovide, making it r easonable t o
conclude that the tr ait ma y have spr ead thr ough the species because it mitigates risk during f eeding.
Choice A is incorr ect because a ﬁnding that E. coli  doesn ’t appear t o be virulent, or danger ous, for C. gr anosus  even when v enom
isn’t used would weak en rather than str engthen Gálv ez and colleagues’ conclusion that a par ticular form of v enom pr oduction
spread in C. gr anosus  in par t because it helps r educe risk during f eeing, since this ﬁnding would suggest that E. coli  isn’t actually a
risk t o C. gr anosus  when consuming pr ey. Choice C is incorr ect because a ﬁnding that C. gr anosus  can detect and a void
consuming E. coli -infected pr ey in the ﬁrst place would suggest that an ability other than v enom pr oduction is the primar y fact or
that r educes C. gr anosus ’s risk when f eeding, which would suggest ther e has been less e volutionar y pressur e to de velop v enom
that pr ovides pr otection; thus, this ﬁnding wouldn ’t clearly suppor t the conclusion that C. gr anosus ’s form of v enom pr oduction
spread in the species in par t because it helps r educe risk during f eeding. Choice D is incorr ect because Gálv ez and colleagues’
conclusion focuses on C. gr anosus  venom in r elation t o the risk of E. coli , and a ﬁnding that the v enom also inhibits nonpathogenic
(not disease-causing) bacteria species, which pr esumably don ’t pose a risk if consumed, wouldn ’t be r elevant t o the conclusion
that C. gr anosus ’s par ticular form of v enom pr oduction spr ead in the species in par t because it helps r educe risk during f eeding.

C. jazz songs that f eatur e the piano ar e mor e likely to ha ve swing than ar e jazz songs that do not f eatur e the piano.
D. the timing of downbeats and offbeats ma y pla y a crucial r ole in giving a song swing. 
ID: 5432d1de  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The passage tells us that par ticipants wer e “more than se ven times lik elier t o char acteriz e the
modiﬁed songs as ha ving swing than t o char acteriz e the original v ersions as ha ving swing. ” Because the modiﬁed songs had been
changed b y altering the timing of the downbeats and offbeats, this suggests that the timing of downbeats and offbeats ma y pla y a
crucial r ole in giving a song swing.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the passage mentions that the r esear chers “ synchr onized the offbeats” in the modiﬁed songs, the y
also “ dela yed the downbeats” in those songs. Because we can ’t disentangle whether it was the synchr onized offbeats, the dela yed
downbeats, or the combination of both that incr eased the song’ s swing, we don ’t ha ve enough information t o mak e this inf erence.
Choice B is incorr ect. The passage doesn ’t mention whether or not it’ s diﬃcult for a jazz musician t o giv e a song swing, so ther e’s
no basis for this inf erence. Choice C is incorr ect. The passage doesn ’t compar e jazz songs that f eatur e piano t o those that don ’t,

Choice B is the best answer because it eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the gr aph t o complete the statement about Rodrigo da Costa
Portilho-Ramos and colleagues’ conclusion. The gr aph shows the r atio of manganese t o calcium in L. per tusa  coral samples fr om
the Albor an Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The gr aph r eﬂects time in appr oximate y ears befor e present: in other wor ds, the
greater the number in y ears noted on the gr aph’s horiz ontal axis, the far ther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the
resear chers tested the samples t o determine whether o xygenation pla yed a r ole in the decline of L. per tusa . The text goes on t o
note that a change in the r atio of manganese t o calcium would signal an inv erse, or opposite, change in o xygenation. Accor ding t o
the gr aph, the r atio of manganese t o calcium in samples fr om the Albor an Sea incr eased fr om about 30 micr omoles per mole
10,000 y ears ago t o about 80 micr omoles per mole 8,000 y ears ago, which means that o xygenation decr eased between 10,000
and 8,000 y ears ago. Meanwhile, ther e was almost no discernible change in the r atio of manganese t o calcium in samples fr om
the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 y ears ago. Accor ding t o the text, the population of L. per tusa  declined
signiﬁcantly ar ound 9,000 y ears ago in the Albor an Sea and ar ound 11,000 y ears ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the
increase in the r atio of manganese t o calcium ar ound 9,000 y ears ago in the Albor an Sea coincides with the decline in the L.
pertusa  population, suggesting an association between the decr ease in o xygenation and the decline in population of the cor al. No
such r elationship is suggested ar ound 11,000 y ears ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, o xygenation lik ely pla yed a r ole in the L.
pertusa  decline in the Albor an Sea but not in the cor al’s decline near the Mauritanian coast.
Choice A is incorr ect because it asser ts the opposite of what the gr aph indicates r egar ding o xygenation in the Albor an Sea, and it
misr epresents what the gr aph indicates about o xygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The gr aph indicates that at the time of the
decline in L. per tusa  (appr oximately 9,000 y ears ago), the samples fr om the Albor an Sea contained a r atio of manganese t o
calcium that was incr easing. Accor ding t o the text, this r atio inv ersely corr elates with ocean o xygenation le vels, so if the r atio was
increasing, o xygenation was decr easing, not substantially incr easing. F urthermor e, the gr aph shows that the r atio of manganese
to calcium r emained r elativ ely stable in cor al samples fr om the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that
there was no discernible r elationship between o xygenation and the cor al’s population decline in that location, not that ther e was a
substantial decr ease in o xygenation corr esponding t o the cor al’s decline. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the gr aph suggests that
the le vel of o xygenation in the Albor an Sea was higher befor e the decline in L. per tusa  than after—because the r atio of manganese
to calcium inv ersely corr elates with ocean o xygenation le vels and this r atio was lower befor e the decline than after—the gr aph
doesn ’t suppor t the claim that o xygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low befor e and after the cor al’s decline
there. Rather , the gr aph indicates that r elativ e to cor al samples fr om the Albor an Sea, the r atio of manganese t o calcium in
samples fr om near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low , which suggests that o xygenation le vels wer e relativ ely high both
befor e and after the decline of L. per tusa . Choice D is incorr ect because it states the opposite of what the gr aph indicates: the
graph shows that thr oughout the period studied, the r atio of manganese t o calcium was higher in cor al samples fr om the Albor an
Sea than it was in samples fr om near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the r atio of manganese t o calcium
inversely corr elates with ocean o xygenation le vels, o xygenation in the Albor an Sea was ther efore lower than, not higher than,
oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Mor eover, even if choice D did accur ately r epresent the gr aph, it
wouldn ’t eff ectiv ely complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean o xygenation le vels at the two locations is not
relevant t o the claim that a decline in o xygenation le vels was associated with the decline of L. per tusa  in the Albor an Sea but not
near the Mauritanian coast.

Karenin was not o verjoyed b y the mo ve to Switz erland [fr om Pr ague]. Kar enin hated change. Dog time cannot be plotted
along a str aight line; it does not mo ve on and on, fr om one thing t o the next. It mo ves in a cir cle lik e the hands of a clock,
which—the y, too, unwilling t o dash madly ahead—turn r ound and r ound the face, da y in and da y out following the same path.
In Pr ague, when Tomas and Tereza bought a new chair or mo ved a ﬂower pot, Kar enin would look on in displeasur e. It

ID: 7f0be746  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text begins b y stating that Tomas and
Tereza’s dog Kar enin f elt disrupted b y a recent mo ve because of his dislik e of change. The text then goes on t o suggest that this is
because the wa y a dog experiences time diff ers fr om the wa y humans experience time: time for a dog doesn ’t mo ve linearly , going
"on and on, fr om one thing t o the next, " but instead mo ves cir cularly , "like the hands of a clock. " That is, time for a dog is
experienced as a cy clical pattern char acteriz ed b y routine and pr edictability , with each da y "following the same path. " The text then
concludes b y providing examples of seemingly insigniﬁcant changes in r outine that pr ofoundly " disturbed [Kar enin’s] sense of
time, " causing him t o feel displeasur e. Thus, the main idea of the text is that Kar enin’s sense of time as a dog inv olves a str ong
preference for pr edictability and an a version t o disruption.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text emphasiz es Kar enin’s displeasur e with the r ecent mo ve to a new home, it doesn ’t suggest
that the mo ve has made his negativ e responses mor e pronounced than the y once wer e. Rather , in accounting for Kar enin’s
displeasur e with the mo ve to Switz erland, the text explains that Kar enin gener ally has a negativ e response t o any kind of change.
Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that Kar enin compr ehends time similarly t o how Tomas and Tereza
compr ehend it. On the contr ary, the text str ongly implies a contr ast between dogs’ cir cular experience of time with the wa y
humans experience time as a str aightfor ward progression that can be " plotted on a str aight line. " Choice D is incorr ect because
the text pr ovides no indication that a change in the places and objects surr ounding Kar enin causes him t o feel as though time is
acceler ating. Although the text does use the language of " dash[ing] madly ahead" in r elation t o time, the phr ase appears in the
context of a comparison illustr ating how dogs experience time: time for a dog mo ves just as the hands of a clock do, in a cir cle

Choice A is the best answer . This ﬁnding would suppor t the conclusion. If str eam banks ar e collapsing int o the water at multiple

contr ol plants. This suggests that when inf ested with whiteﬂies, t omat o plants that wer en’t previously exposed t o air fr om nearb y
whiteﬂy-inf ested plants begin pr oducing higher le vels of jasmonic acid t o def end against the inf estation. Finally , the gr aph also
shows that plants exposed t o air fr om whiteﬂy-inf ested plants and then subsequently inf ested b y whiteﬂies pr oduced
appr oximately 100 nanogr ams of jasmonic acid per gr am of dr y weight (which is less than contr ol plants did) and appr oximately
175 nanogr ams of salicylic acid per gr am of dr y weight (which is mor e than contr ol plants did). This suggests that whiteﬂies
cause t omat o plants t o emit chemical signals that decr ease nearb y plants’ def enses against whiteﬂy herbiv ory relativ e to baseline
levels and r edirect their def enses t owar d micr obial inf ection, ther eby suppor ting the r esear chers’ conclusion that whiteﬂies cause
tomat o plants t o emit airborne chemical signals that induce nearb y plants t o preferentially def end against micr obes e ven when
experiencing herbiv ory from whiteﬂies.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the gr aph shows that t omat o plants exposed t o whiteﬂy-inf ested plants pr oduced less jasmonic
acid than salicylic acid (about 100 nanogr ams of jasmonic acid per gr am of dr y weight vs. about 175 nanogr ams of salicylic acid
per gr am of dr y weight), and although this might suggest that those plants ar e ther efore better def ended against micr obial attack
than against herbiv ory, this wouldn ’t be suﬃcient t o conclude that this is the case: without r eference t o the r elativ e levels of
defensiv e chemicals pr oduced b y the plants in the other experimental conditions, it would be impossible t o conclude that
exposur e to air fr om whiteﬂy-inf ested plants either induces or diminishes these plants’ def enses t o diff erent kinds of thr eats.
Furthermor e, the gr aph shows that plants exposed t o air fr om whiteﬂy-fr ee plants pr oduced about 205 nanogr ams of jasmonic
acid per gr am of dr y weight and about 130 nanogr ams of salicylic acid per gr am of dr y weight, not that the y produced the same
amount of the two acids. Choice C is incorr ect because it inaccur ately describes the data in the gr aph. The gr aph shows that
plants in all thr ee conditions pr oduced both jasmonic and salicylic acid, not that plants exposed t o air fr om whiteﬂy-inf ested plants
produce no jasmonic acid at all. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the gr aph shows that plants exposed t o air fr om whiteﬂy-inf ested
plants pr oduced about 100 nanogr ams of jasmonic acid per gr am of dr y weight when inf ested, which is less than the amount
produced b y contr ol plants (about 140 nanogr ams per gr am of dr y weight), and although the gr aph shows that plants exposed t o

more than the appr oximately 120 nanogr ams per gr am of dr y weight pr oduced b y contr ol plants), this wouldn ’t suppor t the
resear chers’ conclusion that plants exposed t o air fr om whiteﬂy-inf ested plants pr eferentially def end against micr obial inf ection—
that is, that the y incr ease their le vels of salicylic acid and decr ease their le vels of jasmonic acid r elativ e to contr ol plants. Rather ,

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text begins b y stating that María
Izquier do was an impor tant ﬁgur e in the hist ory of twentieth-centur y Mexican ar t, but despite her impor tance, her work hasn ’t
receiv ed widespr ead r ecognition in the United States. Accor ding t o the text, one r eason for this is that F rida Kahlo and Diego
Rivera are so famous in the US that the y overshadow other impor tant Mexican ar tists, including Iz quier do. Thus, the main idea of
the text is that Iz quier do’s work is less well known in the US than it should be because Kahlo and Riv era draw most of the public ’s
attention.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t discuss the appear ance of Iz quier do’s paintings in galleries in the US during her
lifetime, nor does it suggest that her paintings wer e displa yed mor e frequently than paintings b y Kahlo or Riv era wer e. Instead, the
text focuses on the fact that Iz quier do has been o verlook ed in the US because of Kahlo ’s and Riv era’s greater popularity . Choice C
is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t discuss either the subject matter of Iz quier do’s paintings or the techniques she used, nor
does it compar e these aspects of her paintings with those of Kahlo ’s and Riv era’s paintings. Choice D is incorr ect because the text

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the ar gument about an unintended eff ect of the Nago ya Protocol.
The text explains that the Nago ya Protocol is an agr eement ensuring that Indigenous communities ar e compensated when their
agricultur al resour ces and knowledge ar e used b y corpor ations. The text then states that the pr otocol allows corpor ations t o keep
their agr eements with Indigenous communities conﬁdential, about which some Indigenous adv ocates expr ess concern. Choice C,
when inser ted int o the blank, giv es a good justiﬁcation for the adv ocates’ concern: such secr ecy could mean that the public is
unable t o determine whether par ticipating Indigenous communities wer e properly compensated under these agr eements. 
Choice A is incorr ect. The text suggests that because corpor ations can k eep their agr eements with Indigenous communities
conﬁdential, Indigenous communities, not corpor ations, might not be compensated fairly . Choice B is incorr ect because the text
doesn ’t suggest that the ability of corpor ations t o keep their agr eements with Indigenous communities conﬁdential would place

Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would weak en the claim made b y people who fa vor the

Choice A is incorr ect because a ﬁnding about links between subjects’ attitudes and gener al political orientation, r egar dless of age

Ther efore, the ﬁnding wouldn ’t ha ve any bearing on the claim that v oting in an election doesn ’t change a v oter’s attitude t owar d the

Under normal atmospheric pr essur e at Ear th’s sur face, water molecules form a tetr ahedr al network stabiliz ed b y hydrogen bonds
between adjacent molecules. Extr eme high pr essur e, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabiliz es these bonds and
compr esses water ’s structur e, allowing water molecules within or ganisms t o permeate pr oteins and impede crucial biological
functions; y et deep-sea or ganisms known as piez ophiles ha ve adapted t o extr eme pr essur e. Studies ha ve found a positiv e
correlation between the depths that v arious piez ophiles inhabit and concentr ations of a compound called trimethylamine N-o xide
(TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of r esear chers t o hypothesiz e that TMAO reduces water ’s compr essibility .
Which ﬁnding, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis?
A. Water molecules ar e found t o be imper vious t o TMAO even when the water molecules’ tetr ahedr al conﬁgur ation has been

D. Analysis of water ’s molecular structur e under high pr essur e reveals that hy drogen bonds ar e mor e stable when TMAO is
present than when it is not.
ID: 0198240a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis that TMAO
reduces water ’s compr essibility . The text explains that at gr eat depths in the ocean, extr eme pr essur e compr esses the molecular
structur e of water b y destabilizing the hy drogen bonds between adjacent molecules, ther eby allowing water t o penetr ate pr oteins
and harm the associated or ganisms. Howe ver, deep-sea or ganisms called piez ophiles ha ve adapted t o live at these depths and
previous studies show a positiv e corr elation between the depth at which a piez ophile species liv es and the species’ le vel of the
compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with r educed compr essibility of water ’s tetr ahedr al molecular
structur e, a ﬁnding that TMAO helps maintain the hy drogen bonds between water molecules under high pr essur e would str ongly
suppor t that hypothesis.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the r esear chers’ hypothesis suggests a r elationship between TMAO and water molecules’
tetrahedr al molecular structur e, that r elationship inv olves TMAO helping maintain water ’s tetr ahedr al molecular structur e under
high pr essur e; as pr esented in the text, the hypothesis doesn ’t contend that water molecules ar e imper vious t o, or incapable of
being penetr ated b y, TMAO. Choice B is incorr ect because the text discusses how the molecular structur e of water , not TMAO, is
compr essed under extr eme pr essur e and ne ver addr esses how TMAO might be aff ected b y such pr essur e. Choice C is incorr ect
because the r esear chers’ hypothesis holds that water under extr eme pr essur e is mor e resistant, not less, t o being compr essed
when TMAO concentr ations ar e higher . Mor eover, the positiv e corr elation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentr ations
and the depths at which piez ophiles liv e, not between concentr ations of TMAO and the r ate at which water ’s molecular structur e
compr esses as pr essur e incr eases.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis
about the connection between the dusky shark population decline and the eastern o yster population decline. The text indicates
that although dusky sharks don ’t usually eat eastern o ysters, the y do consume cownose r ays, which ar e the main pr edat ors of
eastern o ysters. An incr ease in the abundance of cownose r ays in the r egion in r esponse t o a decline in the abundance of dusky
sharks would dir ectly suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis: a higher number of cownose r ays would consume mor e eastern
oysters, driving down the o yster population.
Choice A is incorr ect because a ﬁnding that ther e’s an association between a decline in the r egional abundance of some of dusky
sharks’ pr ey and the r egional abundance of dusky sharks wouldn ’t dir ectly suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis that a decline in
dusky sharks has led t o a decline in eastern o ysters in the r egion. Although such a ﬁnding might help explain why shark
abundance has declined, it would r eveal nothing about whether the shark decline is r elated t o the o yster decline. Choice B is
incorr ect because a ﬁnding that eastern o yster abundance tends t o be gr eater when dusky sharks and cownose r ays ar e present
than when only dusky sharks ar e present wouldn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led t o a
decline in eastern o ysters in the r egion. The text indicates that the sharks pr ey on the r ays, which ar e the main pr edat ors of the
oysters; if o yster abundance is found t o be gr eater when r ays ar e present than when r ays ar e absent, that would suggest that r ays
aren’t keeping o yster abundance down, and thus that a decline in r ays’ pr edat ors, which would be expected t o lead t o an incr ease
in the abundance of r ays, wouldn ’t bring about a decline in o yster abundance as the r esear chers hypothesiz e. Choice C is incorr ect
because a ﬁnding that consumption of eastern o ysters b y cownose r ays incr eased substantially befor e dusky sharks declined in
regional abundance wouldn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis that the decline in dusky sharks has led t o a decline in eastern
oysters in the r egion. Such a ﬁnding would suggest that some fact or other than shark abundance led t o an incr ease in r ays’
consumption of o ysters and thus t o a decr ease in o yster abundance, ther eby weak ening the r esear chers’ hypothesis.

Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the table t o complete the example of the high cost and low
popularity of world’ s fairs. The text pr esents Chow’ s argument that the United States hasn ’t hosted a world’ s fair since 1984
because people think these exhibitions ar e overly expensiv e and insuﬃciently popular . The text then cites the 1984 W orld’ s Fair as

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses a quotation fr om King Lear  to illustr ate the claim that King Lear
expr esses r egret for his actions. In the quotation, Lear describes striking himself on the head—the same act he ’s engaged in as he
speaks, and one that suggests he ’s deeply upset with himself. Ref erring t o himself in the second person (with “thy ”), the char acter
exclaims “Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!” Lear r efers metaphorically t o his own mind as a gate
that has allowed folly , or poor judgement, t o enter and good judgement t o escape. This suggests that Lear r egrets his attempts t o
test his thr ee daughters’ de votion t o him, r egar ding those attempts as examples of the folly that has enter ed the gate of his mind.
Choice A is incorr ect because this quotation doesn ’t expr ess King Lear ’s sense of r egret over his own actions; instead, it expr esses
his belief that the harm that others ha ve done t o him (or the extent t o which the y have “sinned against” him) outweighs whate ver
harm he himself has caused b y “sinning. ” Choice B is incorr ect because this quotation doesn ’t expr ess King Lear ’s sense of r egret
over his own actions; instead, it expr esses his thoughts about an appr oaching st orm (“this tempest”), which he belie ves “will not
give [him] lea ve to ponder ,” or time t o consider , the harm that he will continue t o experience (“things” that “ would hur t [him] mor e”).
Choice D is incorr ect because this quotation expr esses King Lear ’s vow t o commit terrible actions (or “things” that “ shall be / The
terrors of the ear th”) in the futur e, not his r egret over actions that he ’s alr eady tak en.

In the twentieth centur y, ethnogr aphers made a concer ted effor t to collect Mexican American folklor e, but the y did not alwa ys
agree about that folklor e’s origins. Scholars such as A urelio Espinosa claimed that Mexican American folklor e deriv ed lar gely fr om
the folklor e of Spain, which ruled Mexico and what is now the southwestern United States fr om the sixteenth t o early nineteenth
centuries. Scholars such as Américo P aredes, b y contr ast, ar gued that while some Spanish inﬂuence is undeniable, Mexican
American folklor e is mainly the pr oduct of the ongoing inter actions of v arious cultur es in Mexico and the United States.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t Paredes’ s argument that Mexican-American
folklor e is mostly the r esult of cultur al inter actions in Mexico and the United States r ather than an adaptation of Spanish folklor e.
The text describes a disagr eement among scholars about whether Mexican-American folklor e mostly deriv ed fr om the folklor e of
Spain or originated in Mexico and the United States as cultur es ther e ha ve inter acted. The latter view is the ar gument that P aredes
puts for ward. If Mexican-American folklor e collected in the twentieth centur y mostly consists of ballads about hist ory and social
life that originated r ecently , then that would suppor t Paredes’ s argument, since it would suggest that the folklor e mostly ar ose
after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth centur y and that the folklor e reﬂects cultur al inter actions in Mexico and the United
States r ather than tr aditions fr om Spain. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the inclusion of songs inﬂuenced b y sixteenth-centur y Spanish poetr y among Mexican-American
folklor e collected in the twentieth centur y would not suppor t Paredes’ s view that the folklor e was the r esult of cultur al inter actions
in Mexico and the United States r ather than an offshoot of Spanish folklor e. If anything, the pr esence of such songs among the
folklor e collected in the twentieth centur y would weak en P aredes’ s argument, since it would r eﬂect the inﬂuence of Spanish
cultur e on the folklor e. Choice B is incorr ect because the mer e presence of similarities in Mexican-American folklor e acr oss
regions would not be suﬃcient t o draw a conclusion about wher e the folklor e originated, let alone t o suppor t Paredes’ s argument
that the folklor e reﬂects cultur al inter actions in Mexico and the United States. In fact, since P aredes ar gued that Mexican-
American folklor e is the pr oduct of v arious cultur es inter acting in Mexico and the United States, he would lik ely expect ther e to be
regional v ariations in folklor e as diff erent cultur es ha ve inter acted in diff erent places. Choice C is incorr ect because scholars’
previous ignor ance of the folklor e would ha ve no bearing on P aredes’ s argument that Mexican-American folklor e mostly r eﬂects

Choice B is incorr ect because since the text explicitly states that Merneith ’s husband was a First Dynasty phar aoh, it can be

ID: 7ae8065c  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the use of songs b y the K wakwaka ’wakw
people t o recor d and communicate ecological knowledge. The text indicates that some songs of the K wakwaka ’wakw people of
Canada ’s Paciﬁc Nor thwest r egion document how the people used terr aced gar dens in inter tidal z ones t o cultiv ate clams for food.
The text also explains that ar chaeological e vidence shows incr eases in " clam siz e and abundance " that occurr ed along with the
implementation of this cultiv ation method, suggesting the method’ s eﬃcacy in not just suppor ting clam yields but also impr oving
them. It follows, then, that the use of inter tidal terr aced gar dens, as described in the songs, allowed the ancest ors of modern
Kwakwaka ’wakw people t o maintain clams as a food sour ce and t o cultiv ate lar ger and mor e numer ous clams.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mention anything about cultiv ation pr actices among non-Indigenous people in the
Paciﬁc Nor thwest coastal r egion. Though the text conv eys that ar chaeological e vidence suggests that the clam cultiv ation
practice mentioned in K wakwaka ’wakw people ’s songs was eﬃcacious when implemented, it giv es no indication that people other
than the K wakwaka ’wakw adopted that pr actice. Choice C is incorr ect because the text pr ovides no information about the
archaeological r ecor d as it per tains t o Sakha and Kaluli songs and doesn ’t suggest that ther e is less corr obor ation of pr actices
described in those songs than ther e is of the clam cultiv ation pr actice described in K wakwaka ’wakw songs. The Sakha and Kaluli
songs ar e mentioned early in the text only as examples of Indigenous songs that contain ecological knowledge. Choice D is
incorr ect because ar chaeological e vidence that clam siz e and abundance both incr eased when K wakwaka ’wakw ancest ors
implemented inter tidal terr aced gar dens pr ovides information only about the past use of that method and doesn ’t suggest
anything about pr esent pr actices. The text indicates that knowledge of a past clam cultiv ation method is maintained in
Kwakwaka ’wakw songs but doesn ’t indicate whether modern K wakwaka ’wakw people use that or other ﬁshing and farming
practices used b y their ancest ors.

Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely illustr ates the claim that the speak er has contr adict ory feelings while
experiencing the sights and sounds of spring. This quotation indicates that the speak er is r eclined in a gr ove listening t o a
thousand sounds. E ven though the speak er is in a " sweet mood" and thinking " pleasant thoughts, " those pleasant thoughts also
bring t o mind " sad thoughts. " In other wor ds, these lines illustr ate the claim that the speak er is ha ving contr adict ory thoughts while
immersed in the sights and sounds of spring.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although this quotation r efers t o se veral ﬂowers (primr oses and periwinkles) and indicates that the speak er
is in a "bower ," or shady spot among the tr ees—details which suggest that the speak er is experiencing the sights of spring—it
doesn ’t suggest that the speak er is ha ving contr adict ory feelings, only that the speak er belie ves that the ﬂowers ar e experiencing
enjo yment. Choice B is incorr ect. Although this quotation focuses on the sights of spring—namely , new lea ves on nearb y trees
appear t o be opening up ("The budding twigs spr ead out their fan ") to feel the br eeze—the quotation doesn ’t suggest that the
speak er feels conﬂicted about this: the statement " And I must think, do all I can " suggests the speak er’s determination t o attribute
feelings of pleasur e to the tr ees, not that the speak er is experiencing contr adict ory feelings. Choice C is incorr ect. Although this
quotation indicates that the speak er isn ’t cer tain what the bir ds ar e thinking ("Their thoughts I cannot measur e"), ther e’s nothing t o

Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the means
authors use t o write and r evise their no vels. After stating that many authors still choose t o draft no vels b y hand e ven though
computers ar e now widely used, the text acknowledges the speculation that the opposite choice—using only a computer—would
have had an eff ect on such no vels. Howe ver, the text then points out that e very novel is the singular r esult of a combination of the
particular conditions surr ounding its cr eation. This suggests that it isn ’t possible t o determine the eff ect of any single condition
(such as the means of writing) on its own; thus, ther e would be no wa y to reasonably e valuate how a no vel would ha ve turned out
differently if it had been written b y other means.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that it’ s mor e eﬃcient t o write a no vel on a computer than t o write it b y

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely completes the example r egar ding the ablation r ate of ir on. The table
shows the ablation r ates for thr ee elements—ir on, potassium, and sodium—found in cosmic dust that comes fr om one of four
sour ces. The text sa ys that the ablation r ate for a giv en element in slower-mo ving SPC and AST  dust was lower than the ablation
rate for that same element in faster-mo ving H TC or OCC dust. The text then pr esents the ﬁrst par t of an example of this pattern,
describing an ablation r ate of 28% for ir on in AST  dust. The information that ir on fr om H TC dust had an ablation r ate of 90% is
therefore the most eff ectiv e wa y to complete this example—the comparison of a r elativ ely low ablation r ate for ir on in slower-
moving AST  dust with a r elativ ely high ablation r ate for ir on in faster-mo ving H TC dust illustr ates the tendency of ablation r ates for
a giv en element t o be lower in slower-mo ving dust than in faster-mo ving dust.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that SPC dust, lik e AST  dust, mo ves relativ ely slowly; a comparison of the ablation
rates of ir on fr om two slower-mo ving dust sour ces could not be an example of the diff erence between ablation r ates in slower-
moving dust and faster-mo ving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed t o illustr ate. Choice B is incorr ect because
the example in the text is supposed t o illustr ate the diff erence in the ablation r ates of the same element fr om slower-mo ving dust
and faster-mo ving dust, and the ﬁrst par t of the example pr ovides data about the ablation r ate of ir on, which means the second
part of the example must also be about the ablation r ate of ir on, not the ablation r ate of sodium. Choice D is incorr ect because the
example in the text is supposed t o illustr ate the diff erence in the ablation r ates of the same element fr om slower-mo ving dust and

Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes Gibson ’s appr oach t o art. As the text explains, Gibson, who is
Cher okee and Choctaw , transforms punching bags int o art pieces b y applying (or attaching) t o them beadwork and elements of
Nativ e dressmaking, including leather fringe and the jingles of the jingle dr ess. The text goes on t o sa y that in most Nativ e
communities, the ar t forms of beadwork and dr essmaking ar e traditionally pr acticed b y women. Ther efore, Gibson ’s appr oach t o
art consists of cr eating original works b y drawing fr om tr aditional Nativ e art forms.
Choice B is incorr ect. Because Gibson incorpor ates Nativ e art forms int o his own original ar twork, it can be inf erred that he has
been inﬂuenced b y other Nativ e artists, but the text ne ver suggests that non-Nativ e artists ha ve inﬂuenced him. Choice C is
incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that Gibson designs dr esses inﬂuenced b y boxing but instead that he turns punching
bags, which ar e used in bo xing, int o works of ar t by applying elements of Nativ e dressmaking t o them. Choice D is incorr ect.
Although Gibson does incorpor ate beadwork int o his ar t, the text ne ver mentions the colors or patterns that he uses or suggests

Percentage of A vailable E ggs Eaten b y Cane Toad Tadpoles

Cane t oad 90% no yes
Shor t-footed fr og 7% yes no
Striped burr owing fr og 10% yes no
Dainty gr een tr ee fr og 1% yes no
Nativ e to Latin America, the cane t oad was intr oduced t o Australia in the 1930s. In r ecent decades, tadpoles in the A ustralian
population ha ve been shown t o consume eggs of their own species. A 2022 study showed that when pr esented with cane t oad
eggs as well as eggs of nativ e Australian amphibians, cane t oad tadpoles dispr opor tionately consumed eggs of their own species.
This beha vior r esults fr om their attr action t o bufadienolide, a chemical pr oduced b y the eggs of cane t oads but not b y the eggs of
nativ e amphibians. Howe ver, using data fr om this study , a student wishes t o argue that the pr esence of bufadienolide doesn ’t
entir ely explain the cane t oad tadpoles’ pr eference for cer tain eggs o ver others.
Which choice best describes data fr om the table that suppor t the student’ s argument?
A. The tadpoles consumed a higher per centage of the striped burr owing fr og eggs than the y did of the eggs of the dainty gr een

B. The tadpoles left a cer tain per centage of the eggs of each of the ﬁv e species unharmed, thus ultimately allowing them t o

ID: 80fd9454  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the table t o suppor t the student’ s argument about the r ole
of bufadienolide in the egg pr eferences of cane t oad tadpoles. F or each of ﬁv e amphibian species included in the 2022 study , the
table giv es the per centage of a vailable eggs that the cane t oad tadpoles ate. Accor ding t o the table, the tadpoles ate 10% of
striped burr owing fr og eggs and 1% of dainty gr een tr ee fr og eggs, which suggests a pr eference for striped burr owing fr og eggs
over dainty gr een tr ee fr og eggs. The table also indicates that neither of these species’ eggs pr oduces bufadienolide. Thus, these
data suggest that something other than the pr esence or absence of bufadienolide is needed t o adequately explain the tadpoles’
egg pr eferences.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the table shows that for each of the ﬁv e amphibian species, the cane t oad tadpoles ate less than
100% of that species’ eggs, which demonstr ates that the tadpoles did indeed lea ve some eggs for each species unharmed, this
fact alone is irr elevant t o the tadpoles’ pr eferences for some species’ eggs o ver other species’ eggs. Choice C is incorr ect.
Although the table indicates that the cane t oad tadpoles ate 90% of the cane t oad eggs and 7% of the shor t-footed fr og eggs,
which suggests that the y prefer cane t oad eggs o ver shor t-footed fr og eggs, the table also indicates that cane t oad eggs pr oduceAssessment

shows that for both dainty gr een tr ee fr og eggs and little r ed tr ee fr og eggs, the cane t oad tadpoles ate 1% of those species’ eggs,

In vertical inheritance, par ents pass genes t o their offspring, but in horiz ontal tr ansf er (H T), one species, often bacteria, passes
genetic material t o an unr elated species. In a 2022 study , herpet ologist A tsushi K urabayashi and his team inv estigated H T in
multicellular or ganisms—namely , snak es and fr ogs in Madagascar . The team detected BovB—a gene tr ansmitted v ertically in
snak es—in many fr og species. The appar ent dir ection of gene tr ansf er seems counterintuitiv e because fr ogs usually don ’t sur vive
encounters with snak es and so wouldn ’t be able t o transmit the newly acquir ed gene t o offspring, but the team concluded that
BovB is indeed tr ansmitted fr om snak es to frogs, either dir ectly or indir ectly , via H T.

Choice B is the best answer . If ther e are par asites that f eed on both snak es and fr ogs, the y could carr y BovB from snak es to frogs.
HT could occur “indir ectly ” through those encounters, which fr ogs ar e mor e likely to sur vive than snak e encounters.
Choice A is incorr ect. The team ’s conclusion speciﬁcally ar gues that BovB is tr ansmitted fr om snak es to frogs via H T, and this

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of how
digital technologies aff ected the pr ocess of book cr eation. The text explains that in the late 20th and early 21st centuries digital
technologies lower ed book pr oduction costs most signiﬁcantly in manufacturing and distribution. The text goes on t o point out
that authoring, editing, and book design ar e distinct steps in the pr ocess that occur befor e manufacturing and distribution.
Because the sa vings connected t o digital technologies ha ve been most signiﬁcant in manufacturing and distribution, it’ s

Resear chers now claim that the ridges’ formation mechanism mirr ors that of a strikingly similar pair on Gr eenland’ s ice sheet.
Ther e, sur face water seeped thr ough ﬁssur es in the sheet and formed a water pock et that subsequently disrupted the o verlying
ice, for cing fr agments of it upwar d and outwar d int o peaks, as the pock et froze and expanded. Although E uropa lacks liquid

Choice A is the best answer because it accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text focuses on formations of par allel ice
ridges on Jupiter ’s moon E uropa that ar e said t o be formed b y the same mechanism that formed a par allel set of ridges on
Greenland’ s ice sheet. The text indicates that in Gr eenland, water on the sur face seeps t o the lower por tion of the ice sheet,
resulting in uplift that cr eates the ridges, and it states that although E uropa lacks liquid water on its sur face, the same pr ocess
could be driv en b y an ocean below E uropa’s sur face. In other wor ds, the main idea of the text is that par allel ridges in the ice on
Europa and Gr eenland ar e likely caused b y similar pr ocesses e ven though in Gr eenland the pr ocess begins with liquid water on the

Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t Gómez-Bahamón and her

Gómez-Bahamón and her team hypothesiz e that f emale fork-tailed ﬂy catchers ar e attr acted t o the par ticular sound made b y the
tail f eathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional “ genetic and anat omical div ergence ” between the
two subspecies. If it wer e found that the pitch gener ated b y the tail f eathers of migr ating males is getting higher o ver successiv e
gener ations, it would indicate that the shape of the migr ating subspecies’ tail f eathers is div erging fur ther fr om that of the
nonmigr ating subspecies. And if f emales continue t o prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the f emales of the
migr ating subspecies will become acclimated t o incr easingly higher pitches o ver subsequent gener ations, causing fur ther
divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it wer e found that migr ating males’ tail f eathers wer e producing higher pitches o ver
time, that would suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis.
Choice A is incorr ect because the r esear chers’ hypothesis is that f emale ﬂy catchers pr efer the sounds pr oduced b y the tail

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a quotation illustr ating the claim that the poem conv eys McKa y’s contr asting
feelings about New Y ork City and Jamaica. McKa y ﬁrst pr esents a somewhat negativ e view of New Y ork City , describing watching
“dark ﬁgur es” who “ sadly shuﬄe ” to work at dawn, and then indicates that he would instead lik e to be “in the hear t of the island of
the sea. ”
Choice A is incorr ect because the quotation focuses on a description of only one place (New Y ork City , with its “lonely newsbo y”
and “r ed str eaks” in the sky at dawn) r ather than on diff erent f eelings about two places. Choice C is incorr ect because the
quotation focuses on a description of only one place (which isn ’t named) r ather than on McKa y’s diff erent f eelings about two
places. Choice D is incorr ect because though McKa y presents a negativ e image of an unnamed place with “tir ed cars” that
grumble, moan, and gr oan, and “ old milk car ts“ that rumble b y under “ dull stars, ” the quotation focuses on McKa y’s feelings about
only one place r ather than on diff erent f eelings about two places.

Some ethicists hold that the mor al goodness of an individual’ s actions depends solely on whether the actions themselv es ar e
good, irr espectiv e of the context in which the y are carried out. Philosopher L. Sebastian Pur cell has shown that sur viving works of
Aztec (Nahua) philosophy expr ess a v ery diff erent view . Pur cell r eveals that these works posit an ethical system in which an
individual’ s actions ar e judged in light of how well the y accor d with the individual’ s role in society and how well the y contribute t o
the community . To the extent that these works ar e representativ e of A ztec thought, Pur cell’s analysis suggests that ______

A. the A ztecs would ha ve disputed the idea that the mor ality of an individual’ s actions can be assessed b y appealing t o standar ds

ID: a44c7bd4  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion about A ztec (Nahua) ethics. The text
indicates that, accor ding t o Pur cell’s interpr etation of a vailable A ztec philosophical works, the A ztec ethical system views an
individual’ s actions in r elation t o that individual’ s societal r ole and how the actions aff ect the community . The text contr asts this
view with another held b y some ethicists, namely that actions ar e mor ally good or bad r egar dless of the context in which the y
occur . Thus, Pur cell’s analysis suggests that the A ztecs would ha ve asser ted that the mor ality of an individual’ s actions ar e rooted
in that person ’s position in the community and the actions’ eff ects and ther efore cannot be determined in the absence of that
context.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that mor ally judging an action accor ding t o Aztec ethics r equir es an
understanding of the action ’s eff ects and the individual’ s social cir cumstances, it does not specify that only members of that
society can acquir e this information. Choice C is incorr ect because it implies that the A ztecs consider ed some actions good or
bad r egar dless of the surr ounding context, which contr adicts the text’ s claim that the A ztecs belie ved that the mor ality of an
individual’ s action is dependent on the action ’s eff ects on the community and the person ’s speciﬁc cir cumstances. Choice D is
incorr ect. Although the text indicates that in A ztec ethics the mor ality of an action depends in par t on how it aff ects the
community , this is only one of the two fact ors—the other being the person ’s societal r ole—that need t o be consider ed. Ther efore, it
is possible that two actions with the same eff ect on the community could be consider ed mor ally distinct if the y are per formed b y
individuals in diff erent social r oles.

Philosophers note that many people ha ve an intuitiv e sense that while we ought not t o lie, ther e ma y be cir cumstances in which
lying is permissible. If this intuition is corr ect and we lack an inviolable duty t o speak truthfully , what gr ounds opposition t o lying in
the ﬁrst place? Japa P allikkatha yil has adv anced one answer b y appealing t o a duty t o respect others’ agential inter ests: the
possession of false beliefs constr ains agency , and thus we ought not t o impede the formation of true beliefs unless doing so
prevents a gr eater constr aint on someone ’s agency or an other wise impermissible end.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. One potential means of justifying opposition t o lying is P allikkatha yil’s argument that we ha ve an obligation t o respect other

ID: e80ba20d  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text begins b y noting a common
intuition that lying might sometimes be permissible, which r aises the question of what is the r eason for being against lying. The
text then pr esents P allikkatha yil’s answer t o this question: we ha ve a duty t o respect others’ agential inter ests (that is, we ha ve an
obligation t o allow people t o exercise their fr ee will in or der t o best ser ve their own ends), false beliefs constr ain agency (the
implication her e being that people who ar e deceiv ed about what is true ar e impeded in acting in their own best inter ests), and so
we should not hinder the formation of true beliefs (we should not deliber ately deceiv e a person) unless doing so pr events a gr eater
limitation on someone ’s agency or pr events some other wise impermissible end (for example, it might be mor ally permissible t o lie
to someone in the r are cir cumstance wher e a false belief would lead a person t o act in their own best inter est, and wher e the y
would not do so if the y knew the truth). Thus, the main idea of the text is that P allikkatha yil off ers a potential justiﬁcation for
opposing lying based on r especting agency , while still allowing for ex ceptions in speciﬁc cir cumstances.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t focus on people ’s lack of a principled wa y to identify cir cumstances wher e lying is
permissible or indicate that P allikkatha yil’s argument r esolv es this speciﬁc pr oblem. Rather , the text pr esents P allikkatha yil’s
argument that lies limit agency but ma y be permitted in v ery speciﬁc situations (t o prevent a gr eater limitation on someone ’s
agency or an other wise unacceptable outcome) as one of a number of possible ar guments about why lies ar e undesir able but
sometimes permissible. Choice C is incorr ect because it dir ectly contr adicts the text. P allikkatha yil’s argument, as described in the
text, wouldn ’t lead t o an "inviolable duty t o speak truthfully ." On the contr ary, the text explicitly states that P allikkatha yil’s position is
that inter fering with people de veloping accur ate beliefs is wr ong, ex cept when such inter ference pr events either a mor e signiﬁcant
limitation on someone ’s agency or an outcome that would be unacceptable for other r easons. This indicates that P allikkatha yil’s
argument allows for some ex ceptions t o the duty t o speak truthfully , making it not inviolable. Choice D is incorr ect because
Pallikkatha yil’s argument doesn ’t suggest that if it is permissible t o lie in at least some cir cumstances, then it is unclear whether
there are good r easons for opposing lying in any cir cumstances. Instead, the text pr esents P allikkatha yil as off ering a speciﬁcAssessment

a greater diff erence in br ain activity when listening t o the speech r ecor dings (in Spanish or Hungarian) v ersus the nonspeech

ID: a13c1c66  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . It most logically completes the text. The text sa ys that some scientists can ’t explain why pr olonged
deep sleep is so widespr ead, giv en that the known beneﬁts of sleep don ’t seem t o mak e up for how vulner able it lea ves an animal.
This suggests that pr olonged deep sleep pr obably has unknown e volutionar y beneﬁts that mak e up for the vulner ability .    
Choice B is incorr ect. It doesn ’t logically complete the text. The text only discusses the beneﬁts and risks of one tr ait: sleep. So
there’s no basis for an inf erence about “ most tr aits.” Choice C is incorr ect. It doesn ’t logically complete the text. The text sa ys that
it is alr eady known that pr olonged deep sleep is widespr ead in the animal kingdom. Rather , what some scientists can ’t explain is
WHY prolonged deep sleep is so widespr ead, giv en that the known beneﬁts of sleep don ’t seem t o mak e up for how vulner able it
leaves an animal. Choice D is incorr ect. It doesn ’t logically complete the text. The text only discusses the beneﬁts and risks of one

The Haitian Declar ation of Independence was issued in 1804, bringing t o an end the r evolution against colonial F rance that began
in 1791. W ritten in F rench, which was not the ﬁrst language of most Haitians but which was used thr oughout E urope as the
language of international diplomacy , the declar ation notes that Haiti will not bring r ebellion t o other Caribbean nations, pr omises
to respect the so vereignty of its neighbors—widely underst ood as a r eassur ance t o the United States—and sets up Haiti as an
example for futur e struggles against coloniz ers (an implicit r eference t o the many colonies then found in the Americas). So e ven
though the declar ation is explicitly addr essed t o the Haitian people, it’ s reasonable t o conclude that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. aspects of the declar ation wer e modeled on similar documents fr om other countries.
B. the F rench go vernment ma y have been surprised b y the declar ation.

D. the declar ation actually had se veral intended audiences.
ID: 350e2336  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The passage tells us that the declar ation was written in a language impor tant t o European diplomacy
but not most Haitians, states that the declar ation included " a reassur ance t o the United States, " and made implicit r eferences t o
colonies in the Americas. Because of the messages within the declar ation that wer e lar gely irr elevant t o the Haitian people, we can
assume that the Haitian people wer e not the only audience for this document.
Choice A is incorr ect. Ther e’s no mention in the passage of similar documents in other countries, so ther e’s no basis for this
inference. Choice B is incorr ect. Although ther e’s an implicit r eference t o European go vernments when the passage discusses how
the declar ation was written in F rench, " which was used thr oughout E urope as the language of international diplomacy ," ther e is no
discussion of the F rench go vernment’ s response t o the declar ation. Ther efore, ther e’s no basis for this inf erence. Choice C is
incorr ect. The passage doesn ’t mention the popularity of the r evolution and declar ation among the Haitian people, so ther e’s no

ID: c6b470bb  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses a quotation fr om “Odalie ” to illustr ate the claim that Odalie is eager
to escape the monot ony, or tedious lack of v ariety , of her e veryday life. In the quotation, Odalie describes f eeling “ shut up ” and
complains that she has “ no companions” ex cept for her “ sleep y tante. ” Odalie goes on t o sa y that, as a r esult, her lif e is “ dull” and
she is “r eady for any new sensation, ” meaning she wants a change. This suggests that Odalie wishes t o get awa y from her
monot onous e veryday life.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although this quotation includes the wor d “tir esome, ” which means dull, it does so t o suggest Odalie ’s
negativ e feelings about Mar di Gr as, which is a once-a-y ear celebr ation, not her f eelings about her e veryday life. This quotation
therefore doesn ’t expr ess that Odalie ’s everyday life is monot onous or that she wishes t o escape. Choice B is incorr ect. Although
this quotation ends b y saying that Odalie liv es in seclusion, or isolation, it doesn ’t expr ess that Odalie ’s everyday life is
monot onous or that she wishes t o escape. Instead, it describes the pleasant qualities of the house Odalie liv es in, sa ying that it
has “ quaint windows” and a “ green and cool” cour tyard that is “ made musical” b y the sounds of a fountain and pet bir ds. Choice D
is incorr ect because this quotation describes the liv ely sounds of a Mar di Gr as celebr ation that Odalie hears thr ough her window ,
not the monot ony of Odalie ’s everyday life or her wish t o escape.

Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents the point about the magnetic ﬁeld mapping that the text describes as surprising.
The text indicates that a team of astr onomers mapped the magnetic ﬁeld of G47, a galactic bone in the Milky W ay, and that the
mapping " surprisingly " revealed " no clear pattern or dir ection " in the magnetic ﬁeld. The text then adds that the r esear chers had
thought the magnetic ﬁeld would be as uniform as the magnetic ﬁelds of other galactic bones in the Milky W ay are. In other wor ds,
the r esear chers wer e surprised that the mapping r evealed a magnetic ﬁeld that wasn ’t uniform.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that the mapping surprisingly showed a weak er magnetic ﬁeld than the
resear chers had expected. The text mak es no mention of the magnetic ﬁeld’ s str ength, only its lack of a clear pattern or dir ection.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that the magnetic ﬁeld mapping suggested t o resear chers that pr evious
mappings wer e inaccur ate. Although the text states that the mapping didn ’t show what r esear chers had expected based on their

Euphorbia esula  (leafy spur ge) is a E urasian plant that has become inv asive in Nor th America, wher e it displaces nativ e vegetation
and sick ens cattle. E. esula  can be contr olled with chemical herbicides, but that appr oach can also kill harmless plants nearb y.
Recent r esear ch on intr oducing engineer ed DN A int o plant species t o inhibit their r eproduction ma y off er a path t owar d exclusiv ely

Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. making individual E. esula  plants mor e susceptible t o existing chemical herbicides.
B. enhancing the ecological beneﬁts of E. esula  in Nor th America.
C. enabling cattle t o consume E. esula  without becoming sick.
D. reducing inv asive E. esula  numbers without harming other or ganisms.
ID: 4a85f ea6 Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of leafy
spur ge and engineer ed DN A. The text establishes that using chemical herbicides t o contr ol leafy spur ge in Nor th America can also
harm other plants nearb y. The text then indicates that it might be possible t o use engineer ed DN A to prevent plants fr om
reproducing, which would be useful for “ exclusiv ely tar geting” leafy spur ge. If it’ s possible t o exclusiv ely tar get leafy spur ge with
engineer ed DN A—meaning that only leafy spur ge is aff ected b y the engineer ed DN A—and pr event the plant fr om r eproducing, then
leafy spur ge numbers could be r educed “ without harming other or ganisms. ”
Choice A is incorr ect because the text r aises the possibility of using engineer ed DN A to prevent leafy spur ge fr om r eproducing, not
to mak e individual leafy spur ge plants mor e vulner able t o chemical herbicides that alr eady exist. Choice B is incorr ect because the
text doesn ’t describe any ecological beneﬁts of leafy spur ge in Nor th America; instead, the text is focused on using engineer ed
DNA to prevent leafy spur ge fr om r eproducing and ther eby reduce its numbers. The only ecological eff ects of leafy spur ge in Nor th
America that ar e described in the text ar e harmful. Choice C is incorr ect because the text describes the possibility of using
engineer ed DN A to prevent leafy spur ge fr om r eproducing; it doesn ’t off er a wa y to enable cattle t o eat leafy spur ge without
becoming sick.

Choice C is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the table t o complete the text, pr oviding an example that

annual spending b y international t ourists (which indicates annual international t ourism r evenue) in 2016–2018 in four Asian
countries. Accor ding t o the table, annual spending b y international t ourists in South K orea was $21.0 billion in 2016 and then
decr eased t o $17.2 billion in 2017. This decr ease shows that not all of the countries included in the table saw incr eases in annual

Choice A is incorr ect because the table doesn ’t provide any data r egar ding r evenue fr om t ourism b y residents of those countries.
Even if that data wer e provided, it wouldn ’t be r elevant t o the claim that the tr end of annual incr eases in international t ourism

An analysis b y Alain Ela yi and colleagues of coins minted in Sidon in the ﬁfth and four th centuries BCE r eveals a change in their
composition o ver time: while a coin fr om cir ca 450 BCE contains about 98% silv er and 1% copper , a coin fr om 367 BCE (the end of
Ba’alšillem II’ s reign) contains 74.2% silv er and 24.7% copper , giving it a r elativ ely y ellowish appear ance that tr aders would ha ve
noticed. Because coins with a silv er content below 80% wer e widely consider ed unsuitable for tr ade, Ela yi et al.  speculate that a
crisis in conﬁdence in the curr ency occurr ed in Sidon ar ound 367 BCE, which was lik ely relieved—despite Sidon ’s persistent
oppr essiv e ﬁnancial obligations—as a r esult of Ba ’alšillem II’ s successor Abd’ aštar t I’s decision t o ______

A. proclaim that the per centage of silv er in coins suitable for tr ade would be r aised t o a thr eshold higher than 80%.

C. begin minting hea vier coins with a pr opor tion of silv er to copper similar t o that in coins minted in 367 BCE.
D. fund the mining of some copper deposits that wer e not a vailable t o Ba ’alšillem II.
ID: 1ffd60ce  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Sidonian coins. As the text explains,
resear chers determined that Sidonian coins wer e made of silv er and copper and that fr om 450 BCE t o 367 BCE, the per centage of
silver in each coin decr eased fr om 98% t o 74.2% while the per centage of copper incr eased fr om 1% t o 24.7%. The text indicates
that because the coins containing less than 80% silv er wer en’t consider ed suitable for tr ade (suggesting that copper was less
valuable than silv er) and look ed diff erent fr om coins containing mor e silv er, the r esear chers suspect ther e was a serious loss in
conﬁdence in the curr ency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It’ s reasonable t o assume that it wasn ’t
possible t o boost conﬁdence simply b y devoting a gr eater amount of v aluable silv er to the curr ency , since Sidon was under
signiﬁcant and ongoing ﬁnancial pr essur e; howe ver, keeping the t otal amount of silv er the same and r educing the amount of
copper in the coins would ha ve resulted in smaller coins with a higher per centage of silv er. Ther efore, it mak es sense t o suggest
that Abd’ aštar t I (the ruler after 367 BCE) lik ely restored conﬁdence in the curr ency b y deciding t o keep the amount of silv er in
Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but t o decr ease the coins’ weight.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text conv eys that a crisis in conﬁdence in the curr ency of Sidon lik ely occurr ed ar ound 367 BCE
because the per centage of silv er in coins had fallen below 80% (pr esumably because Sidon ’s ﬁnancial pr essur es meant that less
silver was a vailable for curr ency), making the coins unsuitable for tr ade. Thus, announcing that the thr eshold for the per centage of
silver in coins would be r aised—that is, that coins would need t o contain e ven mor e than 80% silv er to be suitable for tr ade—lik ely
would ha ve worsened the crisis r ather than r elieved it. Choice C is incorr ect because the text str ongly suggests that a crisis in
conﬁdence in the curr ency of Sidon was caused b y the pr opor tion of silv er to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being t oo
little silv er for the coins t o be consider ed suitable for tr ade; ther efore, it’s unlik ely that minting coins with a similar pr opor tion of
silver to copper (that is, still ar ound 74.2% silv er) would ha ve restored conﬁdence, e ven if the coins wer e hea vier. Choice D is
incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that funding the mining of mor e copper would ha ve relieved a crisis in conﬁdence in
the curr ency of Sidon. The text establishes that Sidonian coins that visibly contained copper wer en’t consider ed suitable for tr ade,
so Abd’ aštar t I wouldn ’t ha ve wanted t o add e ven mor e copper t o them, and it’ s unclear how else copper mining would aff ect views
of the curr ency .

Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t Pirotta and her team ’s claim
that East A ustralian humpback whales ma y not liv e only on st ored ener gy during migr ation. The text explains that it has long been

while tr aveling t o their br eeding gr ounds. If it wer e true that citiz en scientists ha ve often seen the whales f eeding as the y migr ate

Choice A is incorr ect because ﬁnding that citiz en scientists ha ve obser ved many diff erent types of marine animals f eeding

A. “Poetry, which brings t ogether or separ ates, which for tiﬁes or brings anguish, which shor es up or demolishes souls, which

ID: 20583752  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely illustr ates the claim that Mar tí argues that a society ’s spiritual well-being
depends on the char acter of its liter ary cultur e. In the quotation, Mar tí asser ts that poetr y is “ more necessar y to a people than
industr y itself ” and that it has the power t o provide people with “faith and vigor .” He also adds that liter ature giv es people “the
desir e and str ength for lif e.” Ther efore, this quotation shows that Mar tí belie ves that liter ature is a societal necessity because it
uplifts people and nourishes their spiritual well-being.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although this quotation emphasiz es the impor tance of liter ature, it focuses on how the natur e of a society is

The linguistic niche hypothesis (LNH) posits that the ex otericity of languages (how pr evalent non-nativ e speak ers ar e) and
grammatical complexity ar e inv ersely r elated, which the LNH ascribes t o attrition of complex gr ammatical rules as mor e non-
nativ e speak ers adopt the language but fail t o acquir e those rules. F ocusing on two char acteristics that ar e positiv e indices of
grammatical complexity , fusion (when new phonemes arise fr om the mer ger of pr eviously distinct ones) and informativity
(languages’ capacity for meaningful v ariation), Olena Shcherbako va and colleagues conducted a quantitativ e analysis for mor e

Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t Shcherbako va and colleagues’ claim that the
outcome of their study is inconsistent with the linguistic niche hypothesis (LNH). The text explains that the LNH holds that ther e is
an inv erse r elationship between the pr evalence of non-nativ e speak ers of a language (ex otericity) and the gr ammatical complexity
of that language—that is, that as the number of non-nativ e speak ers incr eases, gr ammatical complexity decr eases, and vice v ersa.
Accor ding t o the text, Shcherbako va and colleagues focused on two positiv e indications of gr ammatical complexity—fusion and
informativity—and analyz ed their occurr ence in o ver 1,300 languages. If the r esear chers found a slightly positiv e corr elation
between fusion and ex otericity and between informativity and ex otericity—meaning that t o some extent, gr ammatical complexity
increases as the number of non-nativ e speak ers of a language incr eases—their outcome would not be consistent with the
assumption that ex otericity and gr ammatical complexity ar e inv ersely r elated (the LNH).
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t be possible t o sa y that a ﬁnding of a slightly negativ e corr elation between gr ammatical
complexity and both fusion and informativity is inconsistent or consistent with the LNH, since the ﬁnding would addr ess only
grammatical complexity (giv en that fusion and informativity ar e aspects of gr ammatical complexity) and wouldn ’t mo ve be yond
that fact or to addr ess its r elationship t o the pr evalence of non-nativ e speak ers of a language (ex otericity), which is the r elationship
the LNH focuses on. Choice B is incorr ect because a ﬁnding of a slightly negativ e corr elation between gr ammatical complexity
and the pr evalence of non-nativ e speak ers of a language (ex otericity)—meaning that as the number of non-nativ e speak ers
increases, gr ammatical complexity somewhat decr eases, and vice v ersa—would be consistent, not inconsistent, with the LNH,
since the text indicates that accor ding t o the LNH, ther e is an inv erse r elationship between gr ammatical complexity and
exotericity; a negativ e corr elation r eﬂects an inv erse r elationship. Choice C is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t be possible t o sa y that
a ﬁnding of a slightly positiv e corr elation between gr ammatical complexity and fusion is inconsistent or consistent with the LNH,

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the Nacional tr ees’ sur vival in Piedr a de

through the air . The text also mentions that the sur viving Nacional tr ees wer e found in a har d-to-reach v alley in E cuador . Giv en this
information, it’ s logical t o conclude that these tr ees might ha ve avoided inf ection because the y wer e geogr aphically isolated fr om

Choice A is incorr ect because early twentieth-centur y scientists’ lack of knowledge about the inf ection that aff ected many
Nacionals doesn ’t explain how the tr ees in the Piedr a de Plata coastal for est sur vived. The text is concerned with the physical
factors that allowed cer tain tr ees t o avoid inf ection, not with scientists’ understanding of the disease. Choice B is incorr ect.
Although the text mentions that the fungus spr eads thr ough the air , it doesn ’t indicate when this ability was disco vered. Mor eover,
even if the ability t o mo ve thr ough the air was r ecently disco vered, that wouldn ’t explain how the tr ees in Piedr a de Plata a voided

Some astr onomers sear ching for extr aterr estrial lif e ha ve proposed that atmospheric NH  (ammonia) can ser ve as a biosignatur e

Based on the text, Huang, Seager , and colleagues would most lik ely agr ee with which statement about atmospheric NH ?
A. Its pr esence is mor e likely to indicate that a planet is a mini-Neptune than that the planet is a r ocky planet that could suppor t

B. Its absence fr om a planet that’ s not a mini-Neptune indicates that the planet pr obably doesn ’t ha ve life.

D. It doesn ’t reliably r each high enough concentr ations in the atmospher es of r ocky planets or mini-Neptunes t o be tr eated as a

ID: 8f3a200e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it states a conclusion the r esear chers lik ely agr ee with, giv en the details in the text. The text
explains that a biosignatur e gas is a gas that can be used as an indicat or that a planet harbors some form of lif e and some
astronomers ha ve proposed that NH  could ser ve as a biosignatur e gas. The r esear chers e valuating this claim found that the
atmospher e of r ocky planets would be unlik ely to reach " detectably high le vels" of NH  without biological activity , which would
suppor t the pr oposal of NH  serving as a biosignatur e gas. Howe ver, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can pr oduce
NH  in the absence of biological activity . Thus, the text is structur ed to lead t o the conclusion that detectable le vels of NH  in the
atmospher es of r ocky planets could constitute a biosignatur e, but that is not the case for detectable le vels of the gas in the
atmospher es of mini-Neptune planets.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that biological activity lik ely accounts for detectable le vels of NH  in the
atmospher es of r ocky planets but mini-Neptune planets can ha ve detectable le vels of NH  in their atmospher es in the absence of
biological activity . Ther efore, both r ocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can ha ve detectable le vels of atmospheric NH . Choice
B is incorr ect because the text states that for NH  to reach detectable le vels in the atmospher es of r ocky planets lik ely means the y
harbor biological activity , meaning that r ocky planets with detectable NH  usually harbor biological activity . Howe ver, that does not
entail that e very rocky planet with biological activity will ha ve detectable le vels of NH  in their atmospher es. Choice D is incorr ect
because the text claims only that some astr onomers ha ve proposed using NH  as a biosignatur e gas without mentioning a
minimum concentr ation of atmospheric NH  that must be met for it t o function as a biosignatur e gas.

D. It has a pr ograde orbit and ma y not be a r emnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn.
ID: db2da2bf  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the moon with the eccentric orbit. The text indicates that thr ee
of the 20 newly disco vered moons ha ve prograde orbits, meaning that the y orbit Saturn in the same dir ection as the planet’ s spin,
while the other 17 moons ha ve retrograde orbits, meaning that the y orbit Saturn in the opposite dir ection of the planet’ s spin. The
text then states that 19 of the 20 moons appear t o be the r emains of earlier bodies that orbited Saturn but wer e broken apar t in
collisions. The one ex ception is a moon that orbits Saturn in the same dir ection as the planet’ s spin, meaning that the ex ceptional
moon ’s orbit is pr ograde. The text goes on t o state that the ex ceptional moon ’s orbit is so eccentric that the moon ma y have
formed thr ough a diff erent pr ocess than the other 19 moons. The moon with the eccentric orbit, ther efore, has a pr ograde orbit
and ma y not be a r emnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn.
Choice A is incorr ect because nothing in the text suppor ts the idea that the moon with the eccentric orbit lik ely has the same
origin as the moons with r etrograde orbits. Although it’ s true that the moon has a pr ograde orbit (and thus doesn ’t ha ve a
retrograde orbit), the only information the text pr ovides about the moon ’s origin is that it ma y be diff erent than the origin of the
other 19 moons. Choice B is incorr ect because the text states that the moon in question orbits Saturn in the same dir ection as the
planet’ s spin, meaning that the moon ’s orbit is pr ograde, not that its orbit is neither pr ograde nor r etrograde. Choice C is incorr ect
because the text mer ely notes that the moon in question has a pr ograde orbit without giving any indication of what lik ely caused

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The narr ator describes the view he and
his companions ha ve from the balloon: the ear th lies beneath " milky v apors, " and the balloon itself looks lik e another moon. The
narrator goes on t o explain how the people riding in the balloon ar e aff ected b y the ride, explaining that the y are immersed in the
experience: ﬂoating along in " delicious iner tia," or inactivity , like "silent, jo yous, irr esponsible beings. " Thus, the main idea is that the
narrator and his companions ar e completely absorbed in the change in perspectiv e the y gain while riding in the balloon.
Choice A is incorr ect because the narr ator ne ver describes himself as f eeling isolated fr om his companions; instead, he
char acteriz es riding in the balloon as an experience he is sharing with them. And although he does imply a sense of isolation, it is
isolation fr om those on the gr ound, as when he sa ys of himself and his companions, "W e are now alone. " Choice C is incorr ect
because the narr ator doesn ’t suggest that he or his companions ar e troubled b y the eff ects of the balloon ride. Instead, he
describes himself and his companions as "jo yous" and the experience of ﬂoating in the balloon as " delicious. " Choice D is incorr ect
because nothing in the text suggests that the narr ator is surprised b y his companions’ r esponse t o the balloon ride. In fact, the text
indicates that the narr ator and his companions ar e ha ving the same experience: the y’re described as " silent" and " motionless, "

Choice D is the best answer because it accur ately describes data fr om the table that suppor t Rodriguez and colleagues’ asser tion

Robot Hand has a holding for ce of 56 newt ons, four times gr eater than that of the Y ale Model T. Additionally , the gr aph shows that
the Ultr a-Fast Robot Hand has a weight of appr oximately 500 gr ams, slightly mor e than the Y ale Model T’s weight of appr oximately
480 gr ams. Ther efore, the Ultr a-Fast Robot Hand has a higher r atio of holding for ce to weight than the Y ale Model T. Since higher

Jan Gimsa, Rober t Sleigh, and Ulrik e Gimsa ha ve hypothesiz ed that the sail-lik e structur e running down the back of the dinosaur
Spinosaurus aegyptiacus  impr oved the animal’ s success in under water pursuits of pr ey species capable of making quick, e vasive
movements. To evaluate their hypothesis, a second team of r esear chers constructed two batter y-power ed mechanical models of
S. aegyptiacus , one with a sail and one without, and subjected the models t o a series of identical tests in a water-ﬁlled tank.
Which ﬁnding fr om the model tests, if true, would most str ongly suppor t Gimsa and colleagues’ hypothesis?
A. The model with a sail t ook signiﬁcantly less time t o complete a sharp turn while submer ged than the model without a sail did.

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . This ﬁnding would most str ongly suppor t the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail impr oved the
dinosaur ’s ability t o chase quick, e vasive prey. This ﬁnding suggests that the sail helped the dinosaur mak e sharp turns mor e
quickly , which suppor ts that hypothesis. 
Choice B is incorr ect. This ﬁnding wouldn ’t necessarily suppor t the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail impr oved the
dinosaur ’s ability t o chase quick, e vasive prey. It’s unclear how the sail displacing mor e water would r elate t o that hypothesis—it
doesn ’t seem t o be r elevant. Choice C is incorr ect. This ﬁnding wouldn ’t necessarily suppor t the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that
the sail impr oved the dinosaur ’s ability t o chase quick, e vasive prey. It’s unclear how the diff erence in batter y power between the
models would r elate t o that hypothesis—it doesn ’t seem t o be r elevant. Choice D is incorr ect. This ﬁnding would actually weak en
the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the sail impr oved the dinosaur ’s ability t o chase quick, e vasive prey. This ﬁnding suggests
that the sail slowed the dinosaur down—which would pr obably mak e it worse at catching quick, e vasive prey.

ID: e6e6be2d  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the
resear chers’ ﬁndings about purple sea ur chins and sunﬂower sea stars. The text explains that ur chin barr ens ar e areas that used
to be k elp for ests but ar e now co vered b y purple sea ur chins. The text suggests that because ther e is no mor e vegetation t o be
consumed in those ar eas, the ur chins exist in a state of star vation that mak es them less nutritional for many pr edat ors. The text
goes on t o explain that in a study with a choice between two purple sea ur chins, sunﬂower sea stars (a pr edat or species that has
been substantially declining) consumed a nutritionally rich ur chin 42.7% of the time and a nutritionally poor ur chin 37.5% of the
time. Because the sunﬂower sea stars didn ’t alwa ys avoid consuming nutritionally poor ur chins, e ven when nutritionally rich ones
were available, it follows that helping sunﬂower sea star populations t o grow could help contr ol ur chin barr ens b y incr easing the
number of sea stars that ma y consume and thus r emo ve nutritionally poor purple sea ur chins fr om barr ens.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates only that when pr esented with purple sea ur chins, the sunﬂower sea stars in the
study consumed both nutritionally rich and nutritionally poor ones. It doesn ’t suggest that sunﬂower sea stars gener ally pr efer
other marine animals that ar e mor e nutritious; ther e’s no mention of other marine animals. Choice B is incorr ect because the text
doesn ’t suggest that sunﬂower sea stars ar e gener ally r eluctant t o feed on sea ur chins. In fact, the text indicates that the
sunﬂower sea stars in the study did consume sea ur chins, f eeding on both nutritionally poor and nutritionally rich ones. Choice C
is incorr ect because the text addr esses only the willingness of sunﬂower sea stars t o consume the type of sea ur chins found in
barrens (nutritionally poor sea ur chins), not how lik ely other species of sea stars ar e to consume them.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr ovides a quotation that eff ectiv ely suppor ts the student’ s claim about the ﬁlm One Night
in Miami… . The quotation states that in r esear ching the pla y on which the ﬁlm was based, K emp P owers only found superﬁcial
details about what actually happened during the 1964 meeting in Miami between four leading Civil Rights leaders, meaning that
there is v ery little information about the meeting in the hist orical r ecor d. In the absence of gr eater details, it wouldn ’t ha ve been
possible for the ﬁlm t o be a pr ecise r etelling of the hist orical e vents it depicts. The quotation explains that t o compensate for this
lack of information about the meeting, P owers did extensiv e resear ch int o the four ﬁgur es and how the y thought at the time in

quotation eff ectiv ely suppor ts the claim that the ﬁlm is best underst ood not as a pr ecise r etelling of a hist orical e vent but as a
deeply informed imaginativ e rendering of that e vent. 
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the quotation discusses how on learning about the 1964 meeting in Miami, P owers was inspir ed to
write a pla y and, later , to adapt it int o a scr eenpla y, it doesn ’t discuss P owers’ s appr oach t o representing what had occurr ed in the

consider ed writing a “ much longer ” and mor e expansiv e work about the meeting’ s four par ticipants. Choice B is incorr ect because
the quotation doesn ’t discuss P owers’ s appr oach t o representing hist orical e vents in his pla y and in the ﬁlm; instead, the quotation
focuses on the ﬁlm ’s positiv e critical r eception b y mentioning that it r eceiv ed numer ous awar ds and nominations. Choice C is

Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the study

performed b y the capuchin monk eys, such that simpler tasks r equiring less dexterity , or skill, wer e judged b y the same criteria as
tasks that demanded mor e dexterity . Because the study didn ’t account for this discr epancy , the r esear chers might ha ve assumed
that obser ved diff erences in per formance wer e due t o the abilities of the monk eys rather than the complexity of the tasks. In other
words, the r esults ma y suggest cognitiv e diff erences among the monk eys even though such diff erences ma y not r eally exist.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text focuses on the fact that the tasks assigned t o the capuchin monk eys in the study v aried in

Choice A is the best answer because it uses data fr om the gr aph t o eff ectiv ely suppor t Charles and Stephens’ s claim about how
level of information aff ects v oters. The gr aph shows the pr obability of v oting for both high- and low-information v oters in se ven
categories of political orientation. Charles and Stephens claim that “the mor e informed v oters ar e about politics…the mor e likely
they are to vote.” This statement corr ectly asser ts that the gr aph shows a higher pr obability of v oting for high-information v oters
than for low-information v oters at each of the se ven political orientations. Thus, this statement accur ately cites data fr om the
graph that suppor t Charles and Stephens’ s claim about how le vel of information aff ects v oters.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although this statement is corr ect that the only pr obability in the gr aph below 50% is for low-information
voters categoriz ed as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the r elativ e likelihood that low- and high-
information v oters will v ote, and without some r eference t o high-information v oters, this statement cannot help suppor t such a
comparison. Choice C is incorr ect. Although this statement is corr ect that the highest pr obabilities of v oting for low-information
voters ar e at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the r elativ e likelihood that low- and high-
information v oters will v ote, and without some r eference t o high-information v oters, this statement cannot help suppor t such a

any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data fr om the gr aph. F urthermor e, even if we did ha ve this information, the

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t Asmer om and colleagues’ conclusion that the
ITCZ ma y have expanded nor thwar d and southwar d rather than shifting south during the Little Ice Age. The text indicates that the
ITCZ, a band of clouds in the tr opics that is a signiﬁcant r ainfall sour ce, can change position. Data fr om P eru’s Huagapo Ca ve
suggest that the I TCZ shifted south during the Little Ice Age. But accor ding t o the text, if the I TCZ mo ved int o South America in
that wa y, then Centr al America should ha ve been drier than climate models suggest it was. In other wor ds, rainfall should ha ve
been r educed in Centr al America because the I TCZ, a signiﬁcant r ainfall sour ce, had shifted int o South America, but climate
models do not show such a r eduction in Centr al America. The text goes on t o sa y that Asmer om and colleagues tried t o resolv e
this appar ent conﬂict b y collecting data fr om Y ok Balum ca ve in Centr al America and comparing them with data fr om Huagapo,
which led the r esear chers t o conclude that the I TCZ ma y have expanded both nor thwar d and southwar d rather than simply shifting
south. If it is true that Y ok Balum in Centr al America and Huagapo in South America show str ongly corr elated patterns of high
rainfall during the Little Ice Age, such a ﬁnding would suppor t Asmer om and colleagues’ conclusion b y suggesting that the two
areas wer e aff ected b y the same r ainfall sour ce, and thus that the I TCZ ma y have expanded r ather than shifted. 
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e is no information in the text about how , if at all, the I TCZ aff ects temper ature in ar eas wher e it
is located. Rather , the text states that temper ature variations acr oss Ear th’s hemispher es can shift the position of the I TCZ.
Finding that neither Y ok Balum nor Huagapo data show e vidence of signiﬁcant local v ariations in temper ature during the Little Ice
Age would ha ve no clear bearing on Asmer om and colleagues’ claim. Choice B is incorr ect because ﬁnding that both Y ok Balum

conclusion that the I TCZ, a major sour ce of r ainfall, ma y have expanded nor thwar d and southwar d rather than simply shifting

Choice C is the best answer because it accur ately describes data fr om the table that suppor t Barr ett and Ra yﬁeld’ s suggestion

modeling) and pr oduced similar bite for ce estimates (appr oximately 35,000–57,000 newt ons and 35,000–63,000 newt ons,

Parthenogenesis is a form of r eproduction in which a f emale r eproduces without mating. She pr oduces an egg containing a single

handful of species, including pigeons and turk eys. When scientists at the San Diego Z oo analyz ed the DN A of the z oo’s California
condors (a species of vultur e), the y disco vered that two individuals wer en’t genetically similar enough t o any of the males in the

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of par thenogenesis as it r elates t o two
California condors at the San Diego Z oo. The text explains that par thenogenesis is a form of r eproduction in which a f emale
reproduces without mating, pr oducing an egg containing an offspring with DN A that comes entir ely fr om its mother . After noting
examples of par thenogenesis among bir ds, the text then r epor ts on a disco very at the San Diego Z oo. Accor ding t o the text,
scientists at the z oo found that two of the z oo’s California condors wer en’t similar enough t o any of the z oo’s male condors t o be
their offspring. Giv en that par thenogenesis occurs without mating and r esults in an offspring with DN A entir ely fr om its mother , it
can r easonably be inf erred that the scientists concluded that the mothers of the two condors pr obably didn ’t mate with any of the
male condors at the z oo, r eproducing thr ough par thenogenesis instead.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text ne ver suggests that at least one of the condors’ mothers was born as a r esult of
parthenogenesis. Rather , the text suggests that the two condors wer e themselv es both pr obably born as a r esult of
parthenogenesis, which would account for their lack of str ong genetic r esemblance t o any of the male condors in the z oo’s condor
enclosur e. Choice B is incorr ect because the text ne ver discusses wild California condors, only California condors living at the San
Diego Z oo. F or this r eason, the text doesn ’t suppor t a conclusion that distinguishes between how California condors r eproduce in
zoos and how the y reproduce in the wild. Choice D is incorr ect because the text ne ver suggests that the z oo’s female condors
lacked suﬃcient access t o males or that this would be a cause of par thenogenesis, indicating only that the condor enclosur e

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of acceler ated ﬂowering in A. thaliana
plants. The text indicates that A. thaliana  plants show acceler ated ﬂowering at high temper atures. To inv estigate the mechanism
for this acceler ated ﬂowering, biologists r eplaced the ELF3 pr otein in one gr oup of A. thaliana  plants with a similar pr otein found in
another plant species that doesn ’t show acceler ated ﬂowering. The team then compar ed these modiﬁed plants t o A. thaliana
plants that r etained their original ELF3 pr otein. The text states that the two samples of plants showed no diff erence in ﬂowering at

acceler ated ﬂowering at the higher temper ature occurr ed in the A. thaliana  plants with ELF3 but not in the plants without the
protein, then ELF3 lik ely enables A. thaliana  to respond t o incr eased temper atures.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mention whether any plants other than A. thaliana  and stiff br ome show
temper ature-sensitiv e ﬂowering, so ther e is no suppor t for the idea that this type of ﬂowering is unique t o A. thaliana . Choice B is

amount of ELF3 in A. thaliana  varies with temper ature. Choice D is incorr ect. While the text states that ther e was no diff erence in
the ﬂowering of modiﬁed and unmodiﬁed A. thaliana  plants at 22° Celsius, ther e’s no suggestion that A. thaliana  only begins t o

The r ecovery of a 1,000-y ear-old Chinese shipwr eck in the Ja va Sea near pr esent-da y Indonesia has yielded a tr easur e trove of
artifacts, including thousands of small cer amic bowls. Using a por table X -ray ﬂuor escence analyz er tool, Lisa Niziolek and her

signatur es of the bowls with those of the materials still at old Chinese kiln sites, Niziolek and her team can pinpoint which Chinese
kilns lik ely pr oduced the cer amic bowls.

ID: ad680167  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. Accor ding t o the text, thousands of
ceramic bowls wer e found in a r ecovered Chinese shipwr eck. The text goes on t o sa y that Niziolek and her team used a special
tool, a por table X -ray ﬂuor escence analyz er, to determine the bowls’ chemical signatur es. Comparing these chemical signatur es
with the chemical signatur es of materials the y had collected fr om old Chinese kiln sites, the text sa ys, allowed the r esear chers t o
identify which kilns had pr oduced the bowls. In other wor ds, the r esear chers determined the bowls’ origin.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that the r esear chers used technology in the form of a por table X -ray ﬂuor escence
analyz er, it doesn ’t speciﬁcally state that this technology is new . In addition, the text sa ys that Niziolek and her team used the t ool
to determine the chemical composition of bowls that wer e found in a Chinese shipwr eck, not t o locate and r ecover the shipwr eck
itself. Ther e’s no indication in the text that a new technology can help r esear chers locate and r ecover shipwr ecks. Choice B is
incorr ect because the text indicates that the r esear chers collected materials fr om old kiln sites for chemical comparison with the
ceramic bowls, which means that the r esear chers must ha ve alr eady known the location of those kiln sites. Rather than identifying
the location of the kilns, the r esear chers determined which kilns in oper ation 1,000 y ears ago had lik ely pr oduced the bowls that
were found in the shipwr eck.  Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text sa ys that using a por table X -ray ﬂuor escence analyz er tool
enabled Niziolek and her team t o analyz e artifacts in the form of cer amic bowls without damaging them, the text doesn ’t discuss
how r esear chers analyz ed ar tifacts befor e this t ool was inv ented. Mor eover, the point that the bowls wer e left undamaged isn ’t the
text’s main idea. Rather , it’s a detail that’ s provided t o de velop the main idea, which is that the r esear chers used a special t ool t o
determine wher e the bowls had been pr oduced.

Jürgen K ocka and other hist orians of capitalism r arely discuss domestic capitalism in Africa befor e the period of E uropean
colonization, implicitly pr esenting capitalism as external t o and imposed on Africa. Crisla yne Alfagali and other Africanist scholars
have shown, howe ver, that in par ts of Africa, r eturns-focused inv estment, the establishment of open mark ets for wage labor , and
other f eatur es of capitalism pr edated colonization. One r eason for this discr epancy is that hist orians of capitalism tend t o focus
on longitudinal economic data dr awn fr om ar chival recor ds, which do not exist for much of pr ecolonial Africa.
Which statement about Alfagali and other Africanist scholars is best suppor ted b y information in the text?
A. They likely mak e use of diff erent types of e vidence than hist orians of capitalism typically r ely on.
B. They likely diff er from hist orians of capitalism in the methods the y use t o deriv e longitudinal economic data fr om ar chival

C. They likely ha ve a diff erent view about which activities should be consider ed capitalist in natur e than hist orians of capitalism

D. They likely view capitalism as ha ving been mor e beneﬁcial for Africa than hist orians of capitalism do. 
ID: 34c2e387  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about Alfagali and other Africanist scholars that is suppor ted b y the
text. The last sentence of the text explains that hist orians of capitalism gener ally r ely on a type of data that r equir es "archival
recor ds, which do not exist for much of pr ecolonial Africa. " Nevertheless, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars ha ve demonstr ated
that f eatur es of capitalism including "r eturns-focused inv estment,...open mark ets for wage labor , and other f eatur es of capitalism "
existed in par ts of Africa befor e colonization. Because ar chival recor ds typically used b y hist orians of capitalism ar en′t available
for pr ecolonial Africa, Alfagali and other Africanist scholars of pr ecolonial capitalism in Africa lik ely used atypical sour ces for their
studies.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text states that ar chival recor ds containing longitudinal economic data " do not exist for much of
precolonial Africa. " If these r ecor ds don ’t exist for pr ecolonial Africa, then Alfagali and other Africanist scholars couldn ’t deriv e
data fr om them b y any method. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that Alfagali and other Africanist scholars
deﬁne capitalism diff erently than other hist orians of capitalism do. On the contr ary, the text simply asser ts that speciﬁc f eatur es
they found, such as "r eturns-focused inv estment [and] open mark ets for wage labor ," are "featur es of capitalism, " which implies
scholarly agr eement that these activities ar e capitalist in natur e. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate any
effects of capitalism in Africa, positiv e or negativ e. Rather , the text explains why pr ecolonial Africa has been omitted fr om
mainstr eam hist ories of capitalism and pr esents work b y Alfagali and other Africanist scholars that challenges and corr ects the
historical r ecor d of pr ecolonial capitalism.

Electr onic music pioneer W endy Carlos is cr edited with the music for thr ee featur e ﬁlms: A Clockwork Or ange  (1971), The Shining

ID: 2df56712  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it best states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that W endy Carlos scor ed thr ee
featur e ﬁlms: A Clockwork Or ange , The Shining , and Tron. It also indicates that Carlos’ s work on A Clockwork Or ange  consisted
primarily of electr onic arr angements of Beetho ven compositions and that v ery little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for
The Shining  was used in the ﬁlm. But the soundtr ack for Tron consists lar gely of music composed b y Carlos, so it contains mor e of
her original music than do the soundtr acks for the other two ﬁlms. Thus, the main idea of the text is that of the thr ee ﬁlms for
which Carlos is cr edited, Tron featur es the most original music fr om her .
Choice B is incorr ect because it dir ectly contr adicts the text’ s claim that "v ery little of what she and Rachel Elkind composed for
The Shining  was used in the ﬁlm. " Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess the per ceived quality of diff erent
composers, instead, it discusses how much of Carlos’ s original work was used in each of the thr ee ﬁlms she scor ed. Choice D is
incorr ect because it doesn ’t relate t o any of the major themes of the text: the work W endy Carlos did for thr ee featur e ﬁlms, how
much of that work was composed b y Carlos, and how much of her original work was ultimately used in the ﬁlm.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of linguists using social media t o study
changes in language usage in r eal time, pr oviding the speciﬁc example of the aﬃx meng - in Bahasa Indonesia. The text states that
linguists ﬁrst obser ved meng - being used as an onomat opoeic tag on social media, which then spr ead t o being aﬃx ed to existing

Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t diff erentiate between social media ’s usefulness for studying informal v ersus formal

Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of Andr é Izidor o, Rajdeep Dasgupta, and
colleagues’ computer simulations of our solar system ’s development. The text begins b y stating that the simulations led the
resear chers t o conclude that the solar system lik ely formed fr om thr ee giant dust rings that encir cled the Sun. The text explains
that the four inner planets, including Ear th, formed fr om the innermost ring and that the r emaining planets formed fr om the middle
ring. It then explains that in one simulation, the r esear chers dela yed the formation of the middle ring—that is, the y tested t o see
what would happen if the middle ring had formed later than it actually did. They found that doing so aff ected the siz e of the
innermost planets, r esulting in o versiz ed super-Ear ths, planets that ar e much lar ger than Ear th. Since the dela yed timing had the
effect of changing the siz e of Ear th in the simulation r elativ e to Ear th’s real siz e, it’s reasonable t o conclude that the timing of the
middle ring’ s formation was impor tant in determining Ear th’s eventual siz e. 
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text explains that when the r esear chers dela yed the formation of the middle ring in one
simulation, the siz e of the innermost planets was aff ected (which suggests that the middle ring lik ely formed earlier than it did in
this simulation), the text doesn ’t indicate that this was an initial simulation—that is, a simulation that was conducted befor e other
simulations. Mor eover, the text mak es no r eference t o the speciﬁc r esults of any other simulations; ther efore, ther e is no basis for
comparing any conclusions based on the simulation in which the middle ring’ s formation was dela yed with conclusions based on
other simulations. Choice C is incorr ect because the text discusses how altering the timing of the formation of the middle ring, not
the outermost ring, aff ected the four innermost planets’ e ventual siz e in the r esear chers’ simulation; ther efore, the simulation
offers no basis for a conclusion about how the outermost ring’ s formation aff ected the siz e of the planets. Choice D is incorr ect
because ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that the innermost ring pr oduced all the solar system ’s planets. Rather , the text

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Ut o-Aztecan languages. The text explains that
the nor thern and southern br anches of the Ut o-Aztecan language family descended fr om a single language (belie ved to ha ve
originated in what is now the US Southwest), r esulting in similarities acr oss the family ’s languages; howe ver, the br anches don ’t
have similar v ocabular y for maiz e, even though maiz e has been cultiv ated b y all Ut o-Aztecan tribes. The text also indicates that
maiz e originated in Mexico and spr ead nor thwar d int o what is now the US Southwest—the ar ea wher e the Ut o-Aztecan language
family originated. It follows, then, that the language family had alr eady divided int o nor thern and southern br anches befor e maiz e
reached that ar ea; if maiz e had been pr esent befor e the division occurr ed, the family ’s origin language would ha ve had terminology
for it that lik ely would ha ve been r eﬂected in the br anches, meaning the y would ha ve had similar v ocabular y for maiz e. If maiz e
arriv ed after the division occurr ed, howe ver, the tribes in the two r egions lik ely would ha ve de veloped v ocabular y per taining t o
maiz e separ ately , at the times when the y acquir ed the cr op.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text focuses on v ocabular y per taining t o maiz e in the br anches of the Ut o-Aztecan language
family , and r eferring only t o how some Ut o-Aztecan tribes obtained maiz e wouldn ’t dir ectly addr ess the r ole of language. Mor eover,
if nor thern Ut o-Aztecan tribes had acquir ed maiz e from a southern Ut o-Aztecan tribe, it’ s reasonable t o assume that the nor thern
tribes might ha ve also pick ed up southern Ut o-Aztecan terminology for maiz e in that ex change. Choice B is incorr ect because the
text discusses the fact that the nor thern and southern br anches of the Ut o-Aztecan language family don ’t ha ve shar ed vocabular y

Choice B is the best answer because it describes data fr om the gr aph that suppor t the r esear chers’ conclusion that the tr end of

Howe ver, the gr aph shows that par ticipants v aried in their views of ignoble-tr ait candidates (r epresented b y the line with squar es);

ID: 881ba6f1  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that economist Adam
Smith ’s famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putativ ely (that is, widely assumed but not pr oven) intended t o illustr ate a
robust model (a consistently accur ate gener alization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic inter ests can cr eate
broader beneﬁts for the population. The text then emphasiz es the lack of aﬃrmativ e evidence for this idea b y calling out the term
"putativ ely," and explaining that, accor ding t o Ga vin K ennedy , Smith used the metaphor only once in his works, in r eference t o
speciﬁc cir cumstances r elated t o the now-outdated economic view known as mer cantilism, and that the metaphor didn ’t garner
much attention until economists in the twentieth centur y held it up as a par adigm (a theor etical fr amework in the ﬁeld) and ther eby
implied that Smith shar ed some of their views on economics. By emphasizing " putativ ely," the text implies that ther e is no
independent r eason t o belie ve that Smith would agr ee with the metaphor ’s use outside of the speciﬁc context for which he wr ote it
and that, ther efore, the twentieth-centur y economists who used it did so t o suppor t their own views without r egar d for the
metaphor ’s impor tance t o Smith ’s work.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that Smith ’s metaphor was lar gely ignor ed until some twentieth-centur y
economists r evived it and bolster ed its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith ’s metaphor t o self-ser vingly
boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wr ote it. Mor eover, the statement in this choice fails t o
reﬂect the text’ s emphasis on Smith ’s limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text indicates
that some twentieth-centur y economists alter ed the signiﬁcance of Smith ’s metaphor , the text doesn ’t suggest that the metaphor
is a "useful model" of how aggr egate beneﬁts arise fr om individuals’ selﬁsh actions, let alone that this usefulness is unaff ected b y
taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that Smith ’s metaphor was
intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own inter est pr oduce aggr egate beneﬁts and it was written within the

Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis about the plants’
dependence on dissolving r ock. The text indicates that the r oots of the two plant species gr ow dir ectly int o quar tzite r ock, wher e
hairs on the r oots secr ete acids that dissolv e the r ock. The r esear chers hypothesiz e that the plants depend on this pr ocess
because dissolving r ock opens spaces for the r oots t o grow and r eleases phosphates that pr ovide the plants with phosphorus, a
vital nutrient. If the plants carr y out this pr ocess of dissolving r ock e ven when the r ock alr eady has spaces int o which the r oots
could gr ow, that would suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis because it suggests that the plants ar e getting some adv antage—such
as access t o phosphorus—fr om the action of dissolving r ock. If the plants don ’t beneﬁt fr om dissolving r ock, the y would be
expected t o grow in the cr acks that alr eady exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don ’t ha ve to spend ener gy cr eating and
secr eting acids; if, howe ver, the plants cr eate new entr y points b y dissolving r ock e ven when cr acks alr eady exist, that would
suppor t the hypothesis that the y depend on dissolving r ock for some beneﬁt.
Choice A is incorr ect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the V elloziaceae family with similar r oot structur es to
those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn ’t suppor t the r esear chers’ hypothesis that the species discussed in the text
depend on dissolving r ock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the r oot structur es can ser ve mor e functions than
secr eting acids t o dissolv e rock (since dissolving r ock ma y not be necessar y for plants living in soil), but that wouldn ’t suggest
anything about whether the species discussed in the text beneﬁt fr om dissolving r ock. Choice B is incorr ect because diff erences
in the pr opor tions of citric and malic acid secr eted b y the two species would be irr elevant t o the hypothesis that the plants depend
on dissolving r ock. Ther e’s no information in the text t o suggest that the pr opor tion of each acid has any bearing on the pr ocess of
dissolving r ock or on any beneﬁts the plants might r eceiv e from that pr ocess. Choice D is incorr ect because if the two species

Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of F euerborn

didn ’t reproduce with dogs of any outside br eeds) until about 2,000 y ears ago, when ther e is e vidence that the dogs began
interbr eeding with br eeds fr om the Near East. The text also indicates that ar ound the same time, the sites began t o contain glass
beads and other ar tifacts seeming t o be fr om the Near East, e ven though ther e is no e vidence that the people of those sites
traveled widely outside Siberia. Because ther e is e vidence of Near East dog br eeds and Near East ar tifacts at Siberian sites
beginning about 2,000 y ears ago but no e vidence of the people ’s travel to the Near East ar ound that time, it’ s reasonable t o inf er

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t Vikash V . Gayah’s claim that
eliminating the option t o turn left at busy intersections would impr ove traﬃc ﬂow and r educe o verall tr avel times. The text begins
by describing a pr oblem encounter ed b y driv ers in countries with right-hand tr aﬃc—namely that driv ers wanting t o mak e a left turn
must wait for either gaps in oncoming tr aﬃc or for designated left-turn signals befor e proceeding. The r esulting backup of
vehicles causes incr eased tr aﬃc congestion at busy intersections that slows o verall tr avel times. Accor ding t o Ga yah, eliminating
left turns fr om busy intersections in urban ar eas would ease the congestion caused b y vehicles waiting t o turn left. If v ehicles
spend less time waiting at intersections for left turns, faster o verall tr avel times would r esult e ven if some driv ers would ha ve to
drive slightly longer distances t o mak e the desir ed left turn. Driv ers for package-deliv ery companies, who pr esumably spend most
of the da y driving t o destinations acr oss the city in which the y are based, would lik ely pr ovide a good indication of o verall tr aﬃc
patterns acr oss the city . A ﬁnding that after a city had eliminated left turns at busy intersections, package-deliv ery companies
were able t o complete mor e daily deliv eries on a verage—which implies faster tr avel times between package destinations—would
therefore suppor t the claim that o verall tr avel times would decr ease if left turns wer e eliminated at busy intersections.
Choice A is incorr ect because a ﬁnding that a majority of sur vey respondents agr eed with the statement that implementing left-
turn signals at all busy intersections made na vigating str eets in their communities easier wouldn ’t suppor t the claim that
eliminating the option t o turn left alt ogether at some busy intersections—both with and without dedicated left-turn signals—would
impr ove the ﬂow of tr aﬃc and o verall tr aﬃc times. In fact, the text emphasiz es that designated left-turn signals contribute t o
increased congestion because the y requir e driv ers t o wait t o turn left, which r esults in a backup of v ehicles. Installing such signals
at all busy intersections would thus potentially compound the pr oblem of congestion, not impr ove it. Mor eover, although making
streets easier for driv ers t o na vigate might indicate that left-turn signals ar e beneﬁcial t o driv ers, it doesn ’t indicate that o verall
travel times would necessarily be r educed. Choice B is incorr ect because a study concluding that driv ers wait longer t o mak e leftAssessment

The fynbos shrubland is a div erse habitat found only in South Africa. It is adjacent t o the Afr o-temper ate for est, with almost no

Based on the text, what r ole do fynbos r oots most lik ely ha ve in maintaining the bor der between the fynbos shrubland and the

A. Fynbos r oots damage the r oot systems of for est plants, lea ving those plants unable t o acquir e suﬃcient nutrients.

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a conclusion about the r ole of fynbos r oots in maintaining the bor der with the
Afro-temper ate for est that can be r easonably inf erred fr om the text. The text states that plants in the fynbos ha ve "uniquely thin
and long r oot systems that spr ead out o ver lar ge distances t o absorb nutrients fr om the soil. " The text then describes an
experiment wher e for est tr ee seedlings gr own in plots isolated fr om fynbos r oots gr ew at a r ate ﬁv e times gr eater than seedlings
in ar eas near fynbos r oots. This str ongly suggests that fynbos r oots ar e depleting soil nutrients t o such an extent that for est plants
can’t get enough nutrients fr om that soil t o ﬂourish, ther eby hindering the formation of any signiﬁcant "tr ansition space " between
the habitats and helping k eep the bor der between them sharp.
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e is no e vidence in the text that fynbos r oots physically damage the r oot systems of for est
plants. Instead, the text explicitly describes fynbos plants as ha ving "uniquely thin and long r oot systems that spr ead out o ver
large distances t o absorb nutrients fr om the soil. " This description establishes that fynbos r oots ar e specializ ed for eﬃcient
nutrient absorption. The experiment then conﬁrms this function of the r oots b y showing that for est seedlings "isolated fr om the
roots of fynbos plants exhibited a gr owth r ate ﬁv e times gr eater " than those near fynbos r oots. This r esult demonstr ates that when
forest seedlings don ’t ha ve to compete with the nutrient-absorbing fynbos r oots, the y grow much better . Choice B is incorr ect.
Although the text does indicate that the fynbos and the Afr o-temper ate for est ar e distinct fr om, and adjacent t o, each other and
that ther e is " almost no tr ansition space " (area of mix ed fynbos and for est plants), the experiment shows that for est plants can
grow in soil occupied b y fynbos r oots, just not v ery well. So, the idea that the fynbos r oots physically obstruct for est plants is
unsuppor ted b y the text. Choice D is incorr ect because it dir ectly contr adicts the text’ s claim that fynbos r oots absorb nutrients
from, and ther efore deplete, the soil the y’re in, and fur thermor e, nothing in the text suggests that the habitat of the fynbos is harsh

Choice D is the best answer because the quotation dir ectly illustr ates P atty tr ying har d to convince Mrs. Trent t o allow the gr oup t o
continue sharing a r oom. The phr ase "P atty did use all the diplomacy at her command" explicitly shows her making a determined
effor t to be persuasiv e. The quotation fur ther details P atty’s speciﬁc tactics: she " dwelt t ouchingly upon their long friendship, and
their sorr ow at being separ ated. " These details illustr ate the claim b y suggesting that P atty car efully cr afted and deliv ered an
emotional appeal t o Mrs. Trent about the eff ects of changing the gr oup’s rooming situation.
Choice A is incorr ect because although the quotation describes a r eaction b y Mrs. Trent, it does not r eveal anything about the
events or conv ersation that might ha ve prompted this r eaction. Instead of depicting P atty’s effor ts to be persuasiv e during such a

extent of her effor ts to convince Mrs. Trent t o reconsider the change in r ooming arr angements. Choice B is incorr ect because this
quotation describes the r eaction of a gr oup of thr ee students immediately after an encounter with Mrs. Trent. It shows the
outcome of an implied conv ersation but does not pr ovide any e vidence about the t opic or natur e of the conv ersation itself, and
therefore does not illustr ate P atty’s effor ts during a conv ersation t o convince Mrs. Trent t o change her mind about the r ooming

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of Ancestr al
Puebloans’ migr ation t o the Rio Gr ande V alley. The text states that in the late 1200s C.E., the Ancestr al Puebloan civilization
abandoned villages in its original homeland, which included the Mesa V erde site. The text goes on t o sa y that r ecent genetic
analysis has demonstr ated that the modern turk ey population in the Rio Gr ande V alley descends par tly fr om the ancient turk eys
raised at Mesa V erde, and that the genetic mark ers shar ed b y the two turk ey populations ﬁrst appear ed at Mesa V erde only after

1200s and carried their agricultur al pr actices—including the farming of turk eys—t o their new home.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text ne ver compar es the condition of the Rio Gr ande V alley’s terr ain t o that of Mesa V erde’s
terrain, either in the pr esent or in the past. Choice C is incorr ect. Although genetic analysis has demonstr ated that the modern
turkey population in the Rio Gr ande v alley descended in par t from the turk ey population r aised b y the Ancestr al Puebloans of Mesa

Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main purpose of the text. In the ﬁrst par t of the text, the speak er

read “the language of the ﬂowers” and engaged with “the little br ook”). Thus, the text mainly pr aises Dunbar for being especially

Choice B is incorr ect because the speak er describes Dunbar as ha ving r ead the “hear ts and souls of men ” and the “language of

Nothing in the text suggests that the speak er is r ecalling a par ticular afternoon actually spent in natur e with Dunbar; e ven if ther e

climate scientist Geeta P ersad and her colleagues simulated how the amount of water entering aquif ers and the amount being
used for irrigation purposes would change if this wer e to occur . Persad and her colleagues concluded that concentr ation of

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it describes data fr om the table that suppor t Persad and her colleagues’ conclusion. The text
explains that, accor ding t o some climate models, pr ecipitation in the western United States will become concentr ated int o fewer ,
more intense r ain and snow e vents. Accor ding t o the text, P ersad and her colleagues concluded that mor e irrigation will
consequently be needed but that the change in irrigation output will be highly sensitiv e to, or gr eatly aff ected b y, the baseline
concentr ation of pr ecipitation in an ar ea. This conclusion is suppor ted b y data fr om the r esear chers’ simulations of changes in
annual irrigation output in two diff erent scenarios—one in which an ar ea’s annual pr ecipitation is alr eady somewhat concentr ated
and one in which its annual pr ecipitation is e venly distributed. The table shows that if baseline pr ecipitation is somewhat
concentr ated, water use for irrigation will incr ease only slightly , wher eas if baseline pr ecipitation is e venly distributed, water use
for irrigation will incr ease much mor e—9.0% for sur face water and 7.9% for gr oundwater . This diff erence illustr ates the
resear chers’ conclusion that the amount of additional water needed for irrigation will v ary greatly depending on how concentr ated
or spr ead out the annual pr ecipitation in an ar ea alr eady is.Assessment

Choice A is incorr ect because it compar es changes in the amount of water being used for irrigation t o changes in the amount of

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main t opic of the text. The text begins b y stating that
archaeologists in Nor way have disco vered what ma y be the oldest known runest one (a st one with an inscription in the runic
alphabets used in the r egion in ancient times). Accor ding t o the text, the object was cr eated between 1 and 250 CE. The text then
mentions a r esear cher who comments on the runest one’s signiﬁcance t o the study of runic alphabets. Thus, the main focus
throughout the text is a runest one found in Nor way.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text mentions the Ir on Age only t o indicate the er a when the runest one was cr eated and when
runic alphabets wer e in use; ther e’s no discussion of battles during this er a. Choice C is incorr ect because the text mentions the
carbon dating method just once and does so only t o indicate the age of the runest one; mor eover, the text doesn ’t suggest that this
method is new . Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that Zilmer is a runologist, or a scholar of runest ones, it does so

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text indicates that ar chaeologist Mª
Ángeles Medina-Alcaide and her team used r eplicas of P aleolithic light sour ces t o understand how P aleolithic ar tists mo ved
through dark ca ves. The r esear chers learned, for example, that t orches wer e mor e helpful for mo ving thr ough ca ves than animal-

some details about how P aleolithic ar tists tr aveled within dark ca ves.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess the usefulness of ﬁr eplaces for P aleolithic ca ve artists; it only mentions
ﬁreplaces brieﬂy as one of the thr ee lighting methods the r esear chers tested. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t
discuss how often P aleolithic ca ve artists used each kind of light sour ce tested. Although the text does compar e animal-fat lamps
with another lighting method, the point of that comparison is that animal-fat lamps wer e less useful than t orches when walking,
not that one method was used mor e often than another . Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t discuss either how diﬃcult
it was for Medina-Alcaide and her team t o replicate light sour ces or how the team f elt about dr awing conclusions fr om their study .
Instead, the text r eveals that the team was able t o conclude that each light sour ce lik ely had a distinct purpose.

Birds of many species ingest foods containing car otenoids, pigmented molecules that ar e conv erted int o feather color ation.
Color ation tends t o be especially satur ated in male bir ds’ f eathers, and because car otenoids also conf er health beneﬁts, the deeply
satur ated colors gener ally ser ve to communicate what is known as an honest signal of a bir d’s overall ﬁtness t o potential mates.
Howe ver, ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others ha ve found that males in se veral species of the tanager genus Ramphocelus
use micr ostructur es in their f eathers t o manipulate light, cr eating the appear ance of deeper satur ation without the bir ds

A. individual male tanagers can engage in honest signaling without r elying on car otenoid consumption.
B. feather micr ostructur es ma y be less eff ectiv e than deeply satur ated f eathers for signaling o verall ﬁtness.

D. a male tanager ’s appear ance ma y function as a dishonest signal of the individual’ s overall ﬁtness.
ID: 4f9f8ea6  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Shultz’ s ﬁnding about male tanagers. The
text explains that because car otenoids both contribute t o deeply satur ated f eathers and off er health beneﬁts, ha ving deeply
satur ated f eathers is usually “ an honest signal” (a true indication) that a bir d is gener ally ﬁt. Howe ver, Shultz and others ha ve
found that cer tain male tanagers can appear t o ha ve deeply satur ated f eathers e ven if the y haven’t consumed a diet rich in
carotenoids, thanks t o micr ostructur es in their f eathers that manipulate light. If those bir ds ar en’t necessarily eating car otenoid-
rich diets, the y ma y actually be less ﬁt than other bir ds that appear t o ha ve similarly satur ated f eathers; this suggests that a male
tanager ’s appear ance ma y function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bir d’s overall ﬁtness. 
Choice A is incorr ect because Shultz’ s ﬁnding suggests that some tanagers can signal ﬁtness without consuming the car otenoids
that contribute t o ﬁtness, ther eby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can giv e honest signals of their ﬁtness
without consuming car otenoids. Choice B is incorr ect because Shultz’ s ﬁnding suggests that the micr ostructur es in cer tain
tanagers’ f eathers can giv e a dishonest signal of ﬁtness, not that the micr ostructur es ar e less eff ectiv e than actual pigmentation
for signaling ﬁtness. Whether the signal of ﬁtness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how eff ectiv e the signal is: a signal is
effectiv e if potential mates beha ve as though it’ s true, r egar dless of whether it’ s actually true. Since ther e’s no information in the
text about how potential mates r espond t o the dishonest signals of some tanagers, ther e’s no suppor t for the idea that the
dishonest signals ar e less eff ectiv e than the honest signals. Choice C is incorr ect because Shultz’ s ﬁnding suggests that cer tain
male tanagers ma y appear t o be ﬁtter than the y actually ar e, not that scientists ha ven’t determined why tanagers pr efer mates with

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about V eronica W aweru’ s thinking that is suppor ted b y the text. The
text begins b y discussing W aweru’ s disco very of e vidence that ancient v ersions of the boar d game mancala had been pla yed at a
site in the Lewa Wildlif e Conser vancy . The e vidence consisted of many r ows of shallow pits car ved int o stone. The text goes on t o
state that some newer pits wer e car ved on t op of older pits, suggesting that people ma y have continued t o pla y the game ther e
over multiple gener ations, cr eating new pits o ver time. The text then explicitly states that the pr esence of newer pits car ved on t op
of older pits was pr ecisely what caused W aweru t o think that mancala had been pla yed at the site for a long time.
Choice B is incorr ect. While the text does state that W aweru " noticed many r ows of shallow pits car ved int o stone," this
obser vation led her t o belie ve that the pits could ha ve been used as game boar ds for ancient v ersions of mancala but did not
speciﬁcally suggest t o her that the game had been pla yed at the site for a long time. The multiple r ows of pits mer ely suggest that
these pits functioned as par t of a game boar d; the y don ’t necessarily indicate how long the site had been used for that purpose.
Rather , it was the fact that ther e appear ed to be newer pits car ved on t op of older pits that led W aweru t o think that mancala had
been pla yed at the site for a long time. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text states that W aweru found the pits at the Lewa
Wildlif e Conser vancy , this isn ’t the r eason the text giv es for why she thought that mancala had been pla yed at the site for a long
time. The location of the disco very only pr ovides information about wher e the game was pla yed, not how long the game had been
played ther e. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mention any v ariation in the depth of the pits. The text only describes
the pits collectiv ely as shallow and doesn ’t indicate that the depth of the pits fact ored int o Waweru’ s thinking about how long the

Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the table t o suppor t the underlined claim. The text

Swahili. If 61 million people in Tanzania speak Swahili, but only 15 million people worldwide ha ve Swahili as their ﬁrst language,
that means ther e are many people in Tanzania who speak Swahili as a language other than their ﬁrst language. This information

Hip-hop pedagogy is a form of teaching that’ s gaining popularity acr oss school subjects. It inv olves incorpor ating hip-hop and r ap
music int o lessons as well as using hip-hop elements when teaching other subject matters. F or example, Quan Neloms’ s students
look for college-le vel vocabular y and hist orical e vents in r ap songs. Resear chers claim that in addition t o de veloping students’
social justice awar eness, hip-hop pedagogy encour ages student success b y raising students’ inter est and engagement.
Which ﬁnding, if true, would most str ongly suppor t the underlined claim?
A. Students tend t o be mor e enthusiastic about r ap music than the y are about hip-hop music.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . Enr ollment and attendance ar e logical wa ys to measur e whether students ar e inter ested and
engaged. High enr ollment and attendance suggests a high le vel of inter est and engagement.
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t suppor t the claim. Students’ pr eferences between hip-hop and r ap ar en’t relevant t o the
claim, which is focused on whether or not students lik e classes that use hip-hop pedagogy (which includes the educational use of
both hip-hop and r ap). Choice B is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t suppor t the claim. While the ﬁrst par t of the sentence discusses
social justice, the underlined claim focuses on student success, which is unr elated. Choice C is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t

Water ﬂowing ar ound an obstruction cr eates v ortices (patterns of swirls) of v arying siz e; by detecting the v ortices, ﬁsh can

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the second r esear ch team ’s
hypothesis about how a ﬁsh ’s head shape aff ects the ﬁsh ’s ability t o detect obstructions. The text explains that ﬁsh detect
obstructions using water v ortices and that testing b y Yanagisuru, Akany eti, and Liao showed that ﬁsh with wide heads struggle t o
distinguish medium-siz ed vortices fr om gener al turbulence in the water . Based on this ﬁnding, a second r esear ch team
hypothesiz ed that in low-visibility conditions, wider-headed ﬁsh would be less eff ectiv e at detecting obstructions than narr ower-
headed ﬁsh. The ﬁnding that wider-headed bristlemouth ﬁsh bumped int o obstructions mor e often than narr ower-headed dusky
smooth-hound ﬁsh did under the speciﬁed conditions (low visibility with medium-siz ed vortices) would dir ectly suppor t the second
team ’s hypothesis.
Choice A is incorr ect because it would pr ovide only par tial suppor t for the second r esear ch team ’s hypothesis. While this ﬁnding
shows that wide-headed bristlemouth ﬁsh bumped int o many obstructions, it pr ovides no comparison with narr ow-headed ﬁsh.
The hypothesis speciﬁcally pr edicts a diff erence in detection ability between ﬁsh with wider heads and those with narr ower heads,
so suppor ting e vidence would need t o include data fr om both head types t o allow for this comparison. Choice B is incorr ect
because it would not suppor t the second r esear ch team ’s hypothesis comparing obstruction detection between ﬁsh with wide
heads and those with narr ow heads. Instead, it examines v ariation within a single narr ow-headed species, which would not

ﬁnding would contr adict r ather than suppor t the second r esear ch team ’s hypothesis. The hypothesis pr edicts that wider-headed

D. newly hatched Testudo  tortoises show a str onger pr eference for face-lik e stimuli than adult Testudo  tortoises do. 
ID: f2250478  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the study
by Versace and colleagues. The text indicates that newborn animals of some species ar e attr acted t o faces and t o stimuli that
resemble faces. These species, the text sa ys, shar e two char acteristics: the y’re social and the y practice par ental car e, meaning
that par ents car e for their y oung. The text goes on t o describe V ersace and colleagues’ experiment, which showed that Testudo
tortoises, which ar en’t social and don ’t practice par ental car e, wer e attr acted t o a stimulus that r esembles a face. Since V ersace
and colleagues ha ve shown that a species that isn ’t social and doesn ’t practice par ental car e nevertheless has the innate
char acteristic of being attr acted t o face-lik e stimuli, it follows that this char acteristic shouldn ’t be assumed t o be an adaptation
related t o social inter action or par ental car e.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that the t ortoise hatchlings, which ar e solitar y and don ’t practice par ental car e,
were attr acted t o the face-lik e stimuli, not that the y per ceived the stimuli as thr eatening. Choice C is incorr ect because the
phenomenon discussed in the text is an attr action t o faces and face-lik e stimuli on the par t of newborn animals, which can ’t show
any learned char acteristics since the y wer e just born. Additionally , the text tells us that the t ortoises V ersace and colleagues
studied ar en’t social and don ’t practice par ental car e, so any ﬁndings about those t ortoises wouldn ’t be r elevant t o the question of
whether an attr action t o faces in social species that pr actice par ental car e is innate or learned. Choice D is incorr ect because the
text giv es no indication that adult t ortoises wer e tested on face-lik e stimuli and, if adults wer e in fact tested, no information about
how the y responded is pr ovided. Since no information about adult t ortoises’ r esponses is pr ovided, no conclusion comparing
those r esponses t o the r esponses of newly hatched t ortoises can be suppor ted.

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of aer ogels. The text states that aer ogels—
highly por ous foams—off er "excellent insulation " but typically br eak down after pr olonged exposur e to high heat. Howe ver,
accor ding t o the text, Duan and colleagues de veloped an aer ogel that " contr acts r ather than expands when heated" and r ecovers

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the two types of stick t ools used b y New
Caledonian cr ows. The text indicates that the mor e eff ectiv e type of t ool has a hook that the cr ows mak e themselv es, while the
other type of t ool is simply a stick without a hook that the cr ows ﬁnd and don ’t shape in any wa y. Accor ding t o the text, Klump
found that the cr ows k eep hook ed tools—but not the t ools without hooks—in their gr asp or in saf e places when the y aren’t using
the t ools. If the hook ed tools ar e mor e eff ectiv e than the t ools without hooks ar e and the cr ows ar e mor e protectiv e of the hook ed
tools than the y are of the t ools without hooks, it’ s reasonable t o conclude that the hook ed tools ar e mor e valuable t o the cr ows
than the t ools without hooks ar e.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication of how easy it is for the cr ows t o hold either the hook ed tools or the
tools without hooks. The text does state that cr ows hold the hook ed tools and not the t ools without hooks when the t ools ar en’t in
use. Howe ver, the text also indicates that the hook ed tools r equir e work fr om the cr ows t o mak e and ar e mor e useful for helping
the cr ows catch pr ey than the t ools without hooks ar e. This context suggests that the cr ows hold the hook ed tools because the y’re
more valuable t o the cr ows than the t ools without hooks ar e, not because the hook ed tools ar e easier t o hold. Choice C is incorr ect
because the text mak es no mention of the cr ows sharing t ools. Additionally , the text indicates that when the cr ows ar en’t using the
hook ed tools, the y either gr asp the t ools or st ore them saf ely, which suggests that the cr ows tr y to maintain possession of the
hook ed tools, not that cr ows pr efer to shar e those t ools. Choice D is incorr ect because the text sa ys nothing about the cr ows

ID: 16a4a83b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses a quotation t o illustr ate the claim that Lady Ger trude Chiltern is
perceived as “both extr emely vir tuous and unfor giving. ” In the quotation, a man describes Lady Chiltern as someone who “ does not
know what weakness or temptation is. ” In other wor ds, the man r egar ds her as someone who is str ong and adher es to a strict
deﬁnition of mor al per fection. Howe ver, he ir onically suggests that this deﬁnition ex cludes mer cy and for giveness—qualities that
are also thought of as vir tues; accor ding t o him, Lady Chiltern is “ pitiless in her per fection—cold and stern and without mer cy.” This
description suppor ts the idea that Lady Chiltern is per ceived b y others as vir tuous as well as unfor giving.
Choice A is incorr ect. The quotation suppor ts the claim that Lady Chiltern is per ceived as vir tuous, in that it describes her as “ a
woman of the v ery highest principles. ” Howe ver, it doesn ’t char acteriz e her as unfor giving or being per ceived as such. Choice B is
incorr ect. The quotation suggests that Lady Chiltern is concerned with mor ality, but it suggests that her inter est in discussing it is
fundamentally hypocritical and functions as a means b y which t o judge others. Howe ver, the quotation doesn ’t addr ess the
question of whether Lady Chiltern is unmer ciful t o those who seek for giveness for harm the y have caused. Choice D is incorr ect
because it doesn ’t addr ess either Lady Chiltern ’s per ceived vir tuousness or her per ceived lack of for giveness; instead, it expr esses
the belief that she is sensible.

D. the scientists who belie ve an impact caused the Y ounger Dr yas ha ve made incorr ect assumptions about when the period

ID: a0b58ef0  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of a cr ater’s connection t o the star t of the
Younger Dr yas. Accor ding t o the text, some scientists belie ve that a comet fr agment hitting Ear th caused the cooling of the
Younger Dr yas period t o come about. The text then indicates that a team of scientists found a cr ater in Gr eenland, which some
belie ve suppor ts the theor y of a comet fr agment hitting Ear th to initiate the Y ounger Dr yas. Howe ver, the text also notes that the
team was unable t o determine the age of the cr ater. If the age of the cr ater can ’t be determined, then its connection t o the Y ounger
Dryas period of time can ’t be conﬁrmed either . Thus, it can ’t be concluded that the impact that made the cr ater was connected t o
the beginning of the Y ounger Dr yas.
Choice B is incorr ect because though the text suggests that the age of the comet cr ater found b y a team of scientists is uncer tain,
it doesn ’t addr ess whether a comet fr agment can mak e a cr ater as lar ge as 19 miles wide. The text doesn ’t consider the siz e of
comet fr agments and how the y relate t o the siz e of cr aters the y might mak e. Choice C is incorr ect because the debate in the text
centers on the age of the cr ater found, not the cause of the cr ater. The text doesn ’t indicate uncer tainty about what caused the
disco vered cr ater. Choice D is incorr ect because the text suggests that the age of the cr ater found b y the team of scientists is
uncer tain, not that the dates of the Y ounger Dr yas ar e uncer tain or incorr ect. The text states that "the Y ounger Dr yas was a period
of extr eme cooling fr om 11,700 t o 12,900 y ears ago " but doesn ’t indicate any debate about the timing of the period.

to the gr aph, both Study 1 and Study 2 show higher prices for the tick ets under the " pay what y ou think it’ s wor th" condition than
they do under both the " pay what y ou can " and the " pay what y ou want" conditions. That is, the data suggest that both gr oups of

Choice A is incorr ect because it contr adicts information in the gr aph. Although the gr aph shows that students in Study 2 assigned
a higher v alue t o the tick ets than did the age-div erse gr oup in Study 1, which would suppor t the idea that consumer v aluations
were heter ogeneous, the gr aph shows that in the " pay what y ou can " (i.e., what y ou can affor d) condition, the students in Study 2
assigned a higher price (about $40), not a lower price, than the age-div erse gr oup in Study 1 did (about $30). Mor eover, even if it
were true that the students had assigned a lower price in this condition, it wouldn ’t suppor t the r esult described in the text, only
that the par ticipants acr oss the two studies had diff erent ideas of what the y can affor d to pa y. Choice B is incorr ect. Although a

ID: 3ae2638c  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Anita Allen ’s argument about judges
citing philosophers in their judicial opinions. The text indicates that judges sometimes cite philosophers when writing their judicial
opinions and that, accor ding t o Allen, judges tend t o cite philosophers whose views ar e in agr eement with those of the judges
themselv es. Allen claims, howe ver, that the best judicial opinions consider potential objections and r ebut them, which suggests
that judges ma y be able t o str engthen their opinions b y including discussions of philosophers with views contr ary to their own.  
Choice A is incorr ect because Allen ’s claim is that judges could impr ove their judicial opinions b y citing philosophers who disagr ee
with the views expr essed in the opinions, which would necessarily r equir e judges t o consult philosophical works. Choice C is
incorr ect because ther e’s no discussion in the text about making judicial opinions mor e easily underst ood b y any par ticular gr oup
of readers. The focus of the text is on Allen ’s claim that judicial opinions could be str engthened b y the inclusion of discussions of
philosophers whose views disagr ee with those of the judges authoring the opinions. Choice D is incorr ect because the text
presents Allen ’s argument that discussing philosophers whose views judges disagr ee with could str engthen judicial opinions, not
that doing so could bring those opinions int o line with views that ar e popular among philosophers.

Shimmering is a collectiv e def ense beha vior that r esear chers ha ve obser ved in giant hone ybee colonies. When shimmering,
different gr oups of bees ﬂip their bodies up and down in what looks lik e wa ves. This def ense is initiated when hornets ho ver near a
colony , serving t o deter the hornets fr om appr oaching the bees. Resear chers hypothesiz e that this beha vior is a specializ ed

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The text describes a study about how giant hone ybees use shimmering t o def end against hornets,
but not other pr edat ors. The r esear chers conclude that shimmering could be a specializ ed def ense r esponse t o hornets.
Choice A is incorr ect. The text sa ys that giant hone ybees don ’t appear t o use shimmering against other , larger pr edat ors. Howe ver,
it ne ver suggests that r esear chers don ’t know which other def enses giant hone ybees do use for those pr edat ors. Choice C is
incorr ect. The text sa ys that hornets ar e one pr edat or of giant hone ybees, but it doesn ’t say that hornets ar e the main pr edat or of
giant hone ybees. This choice also fails t o mention “ shimmering, ” which is a major focus of the text. Choice D is incorr ect. The text
only discusses the shimmering of giant hone ybees—it doesn ’t discuss other insects’ def ense r esponses at all.

Gorgets, or necklaces with lar ge pendants, ha ve been par t of the cer emonial attir e of tribes fr om the US Southeast for centuries.
One of the oldest examples, the F airﬁeld Gor get, was found in F airﬁeld, Missouri, in 1958. Its o verall design r esembles that of other
art from the r egion during the Mississippian period (900–1600 CE). Y et the image on the gor get is of a jaguar—a species whose
range doesn ’t extend t o Missouri. Jaguar images ar e common in ancient Mexican ar t, and Mexico lies squar ely in the species’
range. Ther efore, some scholars ar gue that long-distance tr ade in Mexican ar t objects br ought the imager y to Missouri, wher e a
local ar tist could ha ve adopted it and incorpor ated it int o the F airﬁeld Gor get.
Which ﬁnding, if true, would most str ongly suppor t the underlined explanation?
A. The F airﬁeld Gor get is dated not t o the Mississippian period but instead t o the earlier W oodland period, which ended ar ound
900 CE.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most str ongly suppor t the underlined explanation that
the jaguar imager y on the F airﬁeld Gor get could ha ve been inspir ed b y art objects br ought t o Missouri fr om Mexico. The text
describes the F airﬁeld Gor get as one of the oldest examples of these necklaces, noting that it’ s similar t o other ar t from the
Mississippian period ex cept for its image of a jaguar . The text goes on t o explain that this is unusual because the jaguar ’s range
didn ’t include Missouri. The F airﬁeld Gor get’s artist lik ely wouldn ’t ha ve encounter ed a liv e jaguar , but since such jaguar images
were common in ancient Mexican ar t (and the jaguar ’s range did include Mexico), perhaps some of that ar t inspir ed the gor get’s
artist. Ther efore, evidence that an ancient Mexican ar t object had been found at a site that was close t o the F airﬁeld Gor get in both
location and time period would str ongly suppor t the explanation that long-distance tr ade fr om Mexico t ook place during the
Mississippian period and that jaguar imager y could ha ve reached Missouri b y those means.
Choice A is incorr ect. The underlined explanation indicates that Mexican ar tistic inﬂuence pr eceded the cr eation of the F airﬁeld
Gorget. An ar tifact fr om Mexico that appear ed in Missouri only after the gor get was cr eated cannot suppor t such a claim. Choice
B is incorr ect. The underlined explanation per tains t o whether the jaguar image on the F airﬁeld Gor get was suggested t o the
Mississippian ar tist who made it b y encounters with depictions of jaguars in Mexican ar t. The appear ance of jaguars in Missouri
after the Mississippian period cannot pr ovide e vidence for such a claim. Choice D is incorr ect. The underlined explanation per tains
to inﬂuence that Mexican ar t might ha ve had on Mississippian ar t, restricted t o the period fr om 900 CE t o 1600 CE. The actions of
contempor ary artists cannot pr ovide e vidence for centuries-old networks of ar tistic inﬂuence and ex change.

how the text for eshadows this conclusion b y the mention of Johnson learning " what other people thought of her pla ys."
Choice A is incorr ect. The passage doesn ’t mention theater companies attending the get-t ogethers, so ther e is no basis for this

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of mosquit o repellents. The text begins b y
explaining that many r epellents work b y using natur al components t o activ ate multiple odor r ecept ors on mosquit oes’ antennae,

Choice B is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules ar e diﬃcult t o extr act fr om chr ysanthemums and

eggs would st op hatching and their r eproductiv e success would be at risk.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that exposur e to low le vels of AL AN had no signiﬁcant eff ect on egg f ertilization

Choice A is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t suppor t the conclusion. It mak es an “ apples t o oranges” comparison b y comparing

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it describes data fr om the table that suppor t the underlined conclusion. The text
accompanying the table states that delta 15-N v alues (a measur e of the r atio of two nitr ogen isot opes) can be used as an indir ect
means of measuring the r atio of human wastewater t o water fr om uncontaminated sour ces—the higher the delta 15-N v alues, the
greater the pr esence of human wastewater . The text goes on t o mention an experiment conducted b y Camacho-Cruz and
colleagues measuring delta 15-N v alues in seagr ass on the Y ucatan peninsula at se veral sites, four of which ar e presented in the
table accompanying the text. Two of the sites noted in the table, Akumal Ba y and Tulum, had intermediate t ourism de velopment,
and two others, Mahahual and Xahua yxol, had low t ourism de velopment. It is r easonable t o inf er that sites with intermediate
tourism ha ve a gr eater human pr esence than those with low t ourism and ther efore are subject t o greater amounts of wastewater
and exhibit higher delta 15-N v alues in seagr ass. Howe ver, Camacho-Cruz and colleagues found that the incr ease in delta 15-N
values was not constant. The table suppor ts this conclusion because the two intermediate-t ourism sites (Akumal Ba y and Tulum)
had delta 15-N v alues that ﬂuctuated consider ably—both had higher delta 15-N v alues than the two low-t ourism sites (MahahualAssessment

dropped signiﬁcantly (in fact, Mahahual, a low-t ourism site, had a higher delta 15-N v alue for that period). The ﬂuctuations in
values in Akumal Ba y and Tulum suppor t the conclusion that these sites experienced inﬂux es of human wastewater intermittently .
Choice A is incorr ect because it inaccur ately describes data fr om the table: in F ebruar y 2017 the delta 15-N v alue in Akumal Ba y
was higher than the delta 15-N v alue in Xahua yxol, not lower . Choice B is incorr ect because the absence of data for delta 15-N
levels in Akumal Ba y in F ebruar y 2016 would neither pr ove nor dispr ove that the pr esence of human wastewater at Akumal Ba y
and Tulum was not constant. Despite the una vailable data, ther e is still enough information t o conclude that delta 15-N le vels at
both sites ﬂuctuated signiﬁcantly and that inﬂux es of human wastewater ther efore happened intermittently . Choice C is incorr ect
because a constancy in delta 15-N v alues would not indicate that the inﬂux of human wastewater was intermittent, but r ather the
opposite. Mor eover, the two periods selected ar e not indicativ e of gener al trends in the whole table (for example, the v alues

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the
eﬃciency of v arious phot ovoltaic cells. The text indicates that Mir anda-P érez and her team found that adding a la yer of per ovskite
to silicon-based cells incr eased the per centage of sunlight conv erted t o usable electricity r elativ e to the per centage conv erted t o
electricity b y silicon-based cells. Using cells with only per ovskite and no silicon, howe ver, resulted in no impr ovement in eﬃciency
over silicon-based cells. The text also states that per ovskite captur es light in the blue r ange of the solar spectrum and silicon
captur es light in the r ed range of the spectrum. If per ovskite and silicon captur e diff erent par ts of the solar spectrum and the
combination of per ovskite and silicon r esults in gr eater eﬃciency than the use of either per ovskite or silicon alone does, then it is
reasonable t o inf er that the impr oved eﬃciency of per ovskite-silicon cells could be attributable t o their making use of mor e of the
solar spectrum than per ovskite-based or silicon-based cells do.
Choice B is incorr ect because it is dir ectly contr adicted b y the text, which sa ys that silicon-based cells conv ert 18%–22% of the
sunlight that r eaches them t o electricity and that cells with only per ovskite ar e no mor e eﬃcient than silicon-based cells ar e.
Perovskite-only cells thus must conv ert 22% or less—not mor e than 29.5%—of the sunlight that r eaches them t o electricity . Choice
C is incorr ect because the text focuses on a possible impr ovement t o phot ovoltaic cells and mak es no mention of any alternativ es
to those cells, so ther e is no r eason t o conclude that phot ovoltaic cells must be r eplaced with some other technology . Additionally ,
the text pr esents solar power as something that curr ently exists, so it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o conclude that solar power will
remain elusiv e. Choice D is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that ther e is a need t o evaluate the eff ectiv eness of
other miner als than per ovskite. In fact, the text giv es no indication that it is e ven possible t o use other miner als than silicon and
perovskite in phot ovoltaic cells. Instead, the text is focused on the eff ect of combining per ovskite and silicon and the diff erent

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a detail that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the r esear cher ’s claim about the
diﬃculty of determining oliv e tree age b y ring counting. The text explains that for many tr ees, counting the dark rings visible in a
tree stump is a r eliable method for determining the tr ee’s age. Howe ver, if oliv e trees ha ve growth rings that ar e diﬃcult t o see, it
would be har d to count the individual rings. Ther efore, the ring-counting method would be challenging or impossible t o use for
olive trees. This dir ectly suppor ts the r esear cher ’s claim that the ring-counting method often can ’t be used for oliv e trees because
it identiﬁes a speciﬁc char acteristic of oliv e trees that could r ender this appr oach impr acticable.
Choice A is incorr ect because the pr obable age of the oldest oliv e tree doesn ’t explain why counting rings wouldn ’t work for
determining oliv e tree age. The older age of some oliv e trees might mak e counting mor e tedious but doesn ’t pose an
insurmountable obstacle t o adopting the method. The r esear cher ’s claim is about the f easibility of the ring-counting method for
olive trees, not about the potential impr acticality of emplo ying this method for par ticularly long-liv ed tr ees. Choice B is incorr ect
because the fact that narr ow gr owth rings might indicate harsh gr owing conditions has no dir ect bearing on the claim that
counting rings often can ’t be used t o determine oliv e tree age. It is possible that gr owth rings that ar e too narr owly spaced might
be diﬃcult t o count, but the r esear cher ’s claim r elates t o the inapplicability of the ring-counting method t o oliv e trees in gener al
rather than t o oliv e trees that ha ve experienced harsh conditions. Mor eover, as long as the y are visible, e ven narr ow gr owth rings
might permit the ring-counting method t o be used t o determine tr ee age. Choice D is incorr ect because the ideal climate
conditions for oliv e trees don ’t explain why counting rings wouldn ’t work as a method for determining their age. While gr owing
conditions might aff ect ring formation patterns, the simple fact that oliv e trees thriv e in hot, dr y envir onments doesn ’t dir ectly

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the M. robustus  population at the

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the disco vered ship. The text states that

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the
chemical content of pigments. The text begins b y diff erentiating between two kinds of pigments: miner al-based pigments such as
red ocher , which get their color fr om ir on o xide, and plant-based pigments, which ha ve a high le vel of carbon. The text then goes
on to describe an analysis b y archaeologists of the pigment of decor ated beads made b y members of the Natuﬁan cultur e around
15,000 y ears ago. The ar chaeologists found that the r ed pigment on some of the beads contained no ir on but had a high le vel of
carbon. Since r ed ocher gets its color fr om ir on o xide, while plant-based pigments ha ve a high le vel of carbon, the r esear chers
concluded that the Natuﬁan beadmak ers used plant-based pigments t o decor ate some of the beads examined in the study .
Choice A is incorr ect because the text does not indicate that the Natuﬁans wer e the ﬁrst t o use plant-based pigments, so it cannot
be concluded that the beads in the study wer e the oldest sur viving examples of the use of plant-based pigments for decor ating
beads. Choice C is incorr ect because the text does not compar e the brightness of plant-based and miner al-based pigments.
Choice D is incorr ect. While it can be concluded that the Natuﬁan beadmak ers used plant-based pigments because the pigment
found on se veral beads had a high le vel of carbon, the text off ers no e vidence that ocher was diﬃcult t o ﬁnd.

Choice B is incorr ect. While a ﬁnding about how common guinea pig imager y is in ancient Puer to Rican ar t would indicate the

Choice D is incorr ect because a ﬁnding about the population siz es of guinea pigs in ancient Colombia and ancient P eru wouldn ’t

mentions two r easons the initiativ e was founded: t o teach y oung people about how the y aff ect the envir onment and t o teach them
“why r ecycling is impor tant. ” Thus, teaching the impor tance of r ecycling t o young people accur ately describes a motiv ation that
the text cites as a r eason for the initiativ e’s founding.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although ar t is mentioned in the text, ther e are no details about ar tists or whether the y are being o verlook ed.
Choice C is incorr ect because the text is explicitly about y oung people and their r elationship t o the envir onment and r ecycling.
Ther e is no mention of adults or outdoor skills. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text discusses y oung people, which lik ely

Choice A is the best answer . Females only tr aveled 9.28 km per da y in the cold-dr y season, v ersus 12.64 and 12.48 km per da y in
the monsoon and hot-dr y seasons, r espectiv ely. Males only tr aveled 15.81 km per da y per da y in the cold-dr y season, v ersus 18.93
and 18.87 km per da y in the monsoon and hot-dr y seasons, r espectiv ely. So, the cold-dr y season was the season wher e both
males and f emales had the least daily tr avel.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although f emales tr aveled least in the cold-dr y season, males didn ’t travel least in the hot-dr y season.
Instead, the y traveled less per da y in the cold-dr y season as well. Choice C is incorr ect. F emales had less daily tr avel in the cold-
dry season than in the hot-dr y season (9.28 v ersus 12.48 km per da y), and males had less daily tr avel in the cold-dr y season than
in the monsoon season (15.81 v ersus 18.93 km per da y). Choice D is incorr ect. In fact, both f emales and males tr aveled the most
kilometers per da y in the monsoon season.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it describes an experimental outcome that would most dir ectly weak en the student’ s
hypothesis. Accor ding t o the text, the student hypothesiz es that Brassica r apa par achinensis (cho y sum) will beneﬁt mor e from
acidic soil than it will fr om neutr al soil. The text then explains that the student planted 16 cho y sum seeds in potting soil with
coffee gr ounds added t o incr ease acidity and another 16 seeds in soil without coff ee gr ounds as a contr ol (a gr oup identical t o the
experimental gr oup ex cept for the experimental modiﬁcation being tested). If the hypothesis wer e corr ect, the plants in the mor e
acidic soil-and-coff ee-gr ounds mixtur e would gr ow faster than those in the contr ol gr oup. Howe ver, choice A pr oposes a scenario
in which the plants in soil without coff ee gr ounds wer e “signiﬁcantly taller ” than those in the mor e acidic mixtur e—an outcome that
weak ens the hypothesis that higher acidity is beneﬁcial t o the plants’ gr owth.
Choice B is incorr ect. If the cho y sum planted in the neutr al soil pr oduced less plant matter and ther efore weighed less than the
choy sum planted in the acidic soil-and-coff ee-gr ounds mixtur e, this ﬁnding would str engthen the student’ s hypothesis, not
weak en it. Choice C is incorr ect. If seeds planted in neutr al soil (without coff ee gr ounds) spr outed signiﬁcantly later than seeds
planted in the acidic soil-and-coff ee-gr ounds mixtur e, this ﬁnding would str engthen, not weak en, the student’ s hypothesis that
acidic soil beneﬁts cho y sum. Choice D is incorr ect. If seeds planted in the neutr al soil (without coff ee gr ounds) spr outed
signiﬁcantly f ewer plants than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coff ee-gr ounds mixtur e did, this ﬁnding would str engthen, not

Initially obser ved in 2017, the interstellar object ‘Oumuamua is the ﬁrst object of its kind t o be seen in our solar system.
Resear chers ha ve been puzzled because its acceler ation cannot be entir ely explained b y the gr avitational pull of nearb y bodies:
there must be a nongr avitational inﬂuence on its v elocity and tr aject ory. Some pr eviously suggested explanations for this
nongr avitational acceler ation inv olve mechanisms that ar e unlik ely or unr ealistic, such as geometric eff ects fr om ‘Oumuamua
being potentially composed of se veral spatially separ ated bodies. Now , Jennif er Ber gner and colleagues pr opose that the
nongr avitational acceler ation is due t o the gaseous expulsion of entr apped hy drogen fr om ‘Oumuamua ’s water-rich icy body .
Which statement, if true, would most str ongly suppor t the claim made b y Ber gner and colleagues about the cause of ‘Oumuamua ’s
acceler ation?
A. Existing pr oposed models of outgassing fr om ‘Oumuamua include the dir ect conv ersion of nitr ogen or carbon mono xide fr om
a solid t o a gaseous state without becoming liquid, but these models ha ve theor etical or obser vational inconsistencies.
B. ‘Oumuamua ’s traject ory is inconsistent with a nongr avitational acceler ation that would be caused b y the r elease of hy drogen
gas r esulting fr om the pr ocessing of water ice (H O), but the interstellar object’ s obser vable pr oper ties can be explained if it
has a signiﬁcant component of molecular hy drogen ice (H ).
C. Since nongr avitational acceler ations of interstellar objects ar e several or ders of magnitude weak er than gr avitational
acceler ations, de viation fr om beha vior that could be fully attributed t o gravitational pull has been detected on a limited number
of objects similar t o ‘Oumuamua.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents ﬁndings that, if true, would suppor t the claim made b y Ber gner and colleagues
that the nongr avitational acceler ation of ‘Oumuamua is due t o the expulsion of entr apped hy drogen. The text ﬁrst intr oduces the
obser vation of a unique interstellar object named ‘Oumuamua and goes on t o explain that the object exhibited nongr avitational
acceler ation that could not be fully attributed t o the expected cause: gr avitational pull of nearb y celestial bodies. The text
concludes b y stating that Ber gner and colleagues claim that the nongr avitational acceler ation is caused b y expulsion of hy drogen
gas fr om ‘Oumuamua ’s water-rich icy body . To suppor t this claim r equir es evidence that hy drogen gas could be pr esent within
‘Oumuamua at all, which this answer choice pr esents: cosmic r adiation can r esult in embedded pock ets of hy drogen gas in water
ice. Additionally , evidence that this gas can be r eleased fr om such a body is r equir ed to fully suppor t the claim, which this answer
choice goes on t o provide: ‘Oumuamua experienced suﬃcient warming as it tr aveled thr ough the solar system t o alter its icy
structur e and r elease the hy drogen gas. Thus, this answer choice pr ovides the best e vidence t o suppor t Ber gner and colleagues’
claim.
Choice A is incorr ect because this answer choice concerns faults with pr evious models of outgassing fr om ‘Oumuamua of carbon
mono xide and nitr ogen, which would not suppor t a claim r egar ding hy drogen outgassing. F urthermor e, inconsistencies in other

Furthermor e, the r emaining por tion of this answer choice is unr elated t o the claim. Choice C is incorr ect because the claim being
made b y Ber gner and colleagues concerns the expulsion of entr apped hy drogen gas, but this answer choice is concerned solely

Choice C is the best answer . The text tells us that “ actors tended t o highly exagger ate their actions and expr essions” in ﬁlms

A student in a political science course is writing a paper on Arist otle’s The P olitics , in which Arist otle off ers his opinion on political

A. “When constructing his ar gument r egar ding the char acteristics of a well-functioning go vernment, Arist otle asser ts that
‘Transgr ession cr eeps in unper ceived and at last ruins the state, ’ illustr ating this idea with a comparison t o frequent small

B. “When Arist otle writes on the necessity of a voiding corruption in go vernment, he pr oposes that ‘ every state should be so

dangers that would r esult fr om a constitutional collapse. ”
D. “When contr asting diff erent forms of go vernment, Arist otle holds that ‘ oligar chies ma y last, not fr om any inher ent stability in
such forms of go vernment, but because the rulers ar e on good terms both with the unenfr anchised and with the go verning

that in a healthy state, laws must be followed as strictly as possible and infr actions should not be o verlook ed e ven if the y are
minor . The philosopher states that when Arist otle builds his ar gument about the char acteristics of a well-functioning go vernment,
Arist otle asser ts that tr ansgr ession, or violation of law , will ruin the state if it " creeps in unper ceived," or goes unnoticed. The
philosopher then adds that Arist otle illustr ates this point b y comparing the situation t o one in which small but fr equent expenses
diminish a for tune almost unnoticeably until, e ventually , the for tune is entir ely gone. In other wor ds, the philosopher indicates that
Arist otle mak es the point that t otal obedience t o law pr eser ves a healthy state while e ven small violations, if ignor ed, will
undermine the health of the state.
Choice B is incorr ect because the philosopher addr esses Arist otle’s obser vation about corruption within the go vernment (in

Choice D is the best answer because it pr ovides the most dir ect suppor t from the table for the claim that the plants gr owing in

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically follows fr om the text’ s point about zines t oday. The text describes zines as a

ID: bcbcc43f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Sumerian
civilization and cr op gr owth. The text mentions the hot, sunny weather in the ar ea wher e the Sumerians liv ed, which made cr ops
grow quickly but also made it diﬃcult t o keep them aliv e. The Sumerians solv ed this pr oblem b y using riv er water for their farming
—as a r esult, the y often har vested mor e crops than wer e needed in a season. It follows that the Sumerians must ha ve needed t o
ﬁnd something t o do with the surplus cr ops—that is, the y stored the extr a crops for later use.
Choice A is incorr ect because it doesn ’t logically follow that a surplus in cr ops would lead the Sumerians t o choose only cer tain
days of the season t o har vest. Nor is ther e any indication in the text that the Sumerians impr oved their farming methods with the
goal of r educing the time spent farming. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that the Sumerians tried t o shield
their cr ops fr om the sun: in fact, the text indicates that the sunny weather helped cr ops gr ow v ery quickly and that the Sumerians
used riv er water t o allow cr ops t o be exposed t o the sun without dying. Choice C is incorr ect. Ha ving a surplus of cr ops wouldn ’t
have caused the Sumerians t o begin farming until long after 4000 BCE: in fact, since the text indicates that the Sumerian
civilization formed ar ound 4000 BCE and farming was a par t of that civilization, the statement that Sumerians only began farming
long after 4000 BCE isn ’t suppor ted b y the text.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’ s discussion of competing
claims about the origins of r ed velvet cak e. The text states that the origins of the r ecipe for r ed velvet cak e "are unclear ." The text
then pr esents four diff erent entities that claim t o ha ve created the ﬁrst r ed velvet cak e recipe: a Dallas bak ery (1860s), the Adams
Extract Co. (1930s), a US hotel (1930s), and a Canadian depar tment st ore (1930s). Lastly , the text states that " no clear e vidence
has emer ged t o favor one of these claims o ver the others. " Giv en this information, it most logically follows that it’ s not possible t o
determine who bak ed the ﬁrst r ed velvet cak e, as ther e is insuﬃcient e vidence t o determine which claim, if any , is corr ect.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t provide information indicating that r ed velvet cak e existed befor e the 1860s.
Accor ding t o the text, the earliest claim for cr eating r ed velvet cak e comes fr om a bak ery in Dallas, Texas, that asser ted it
developed the ﬁrst r ecipe for the cak e at the time of the bak ery’s opening in the 1860s. Ther e’s no textual suppor t for the
conclusion that the cak e existed befor e this earliest claimed date, since the text pr esents only competing claims star ting fr om the
1860s and extending t o the 1930s without e vidence of earlier origins. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suppor t the
conclusion that none of the supposed inv entors of r ed velvet cak e likely inv ented the cak e. The text states that multiple entities
claim t o ha ve inv ented the r ecipe and that " no clear e vidence has emer ged t o favor one of these claims o ver the others. " This lack
of decisiv e evidence doesn ’t logically lead t o the conclusion that all the claims ar e false; it mer ely indicates that the cak e’s true
origins can ’t be determined with the a vailable e vidence. The text lea ves open the possibility that one of the claimants could indeed
be the actual inv entor. Choice D is incorr ect because the text pr ovides no basis for concluding that the Dallas bak ery is " probably "
the inv entor of r ed velvet cak e. While the text mentions that this bak ery claims t o ha ve created the r ecipe in the 1860s (making it
the earliest claim), the text explicitly states that ther e’s no deﬁnitiv e evidence suppor ting any of the claims about the cak e’s origins

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text. The text explains that the Cantar es Mexicanos  contains
poems about the A ztec Empir e from befor e the Spanish inv asion. F urthermor e, it indicates that notes in the collection attest that
some of these poems pr edate the Spanish inv asion, while some cust oms depicted ar e likely Spanish in origin. The implication is
that some poems wer e composed befor e the inv asion but the r eferences t o Spanish cust oms could ha ve come about only after
the inv asion, and thus that the collection includes content that pr edates the inv asion and also content fr om after the inv asion.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text clearly indicates that the collection is in Nahuatl, not Spanish, so the compilers’ unfamiliarity

ID: 4802f6a5  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of aptamers’ capacity t o test for pathogens
in food. The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used t o test for foodborne bacterial pathogens
because the y bind t o tar get molecules, it hasn ’t been clear how lik ely it is that the y will indicate a negativ e result when a tar get
pathogen is absent in r eal-world foods. The text then indicates that Somv anshi et al. cr eated test paper that changes fr om pink t o
purple when aptamers in it bind t o a par ticular str ain of E. coli  bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with st ore-bought pear juice (that is,
a real-world food); the paper changed t o purple when exposed t o juice t o which the tar get pathogen E. coli  O157:H7 had been
added, but it r emained pink when exposed t o juice tr eated with other E. coli  strains or other bacteria species. Based on this r esult,
it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound t o the tar get (O157:H7) and the tests had a high degr ee of speciﬁcity
(providing negativ e results for samples wher e the tar get was absent e ven though other bacteria wer e present) when applied t o a
real-world food.
Choice A is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that E. coli  O157:H7 diff ers fr om other pathogens in a wa y that mak es it
more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that speciﬁcity is lik ely to be lower when aptamer-based tests tar get
other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somv anshi et al. used O157:H7 as the tar get for aptamer-based test paper in their
study and suggests that the paper had a high degr ee of speciﬁcity . Choice B is incorr ect because the text indicates that the
speciﬁcity of aptamer-based tests in r eal-world foods is uncer tain for pathogens br oadly , not just for E. coli , and similarity between
strains (of E. coli  or of other pathogens) isn ’t mentioned. Mor eover, the r esults pr esented in the text suggest that aptamers ar e
actually capable of distinguishing between str ains of E. coli , since Somv anshi et al. ’s paper turned purple when exposed t o E. coli
O157:H7 and r emained pink when exposed t o other str ains. Choice C is incorr ect because the text suggests that the aptamers in
the test papers didn ’t bind t o diff erent str ains of E. coli . The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind
to the tar geted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed t o samples with the tar geted

“Gestur es” in painting ar e typically thought of as bold, expr essiv e brushstr okes. In the 1970s, American painter Jack Whitten built
a 12-foot (3.7-meter) t ool he named the “ developer ” to apply paint t o an entir e canv as in one motion, r esulting in his series of
“slab” paintings fr om that decade.  Whitten described this pr ocess as making an entir e painting in “ one gestur e,” signaling a clear
depar ture from the pr evalence of gestur es in his work fr om the 1960s. Some ar t hist orians claim this shift r epresents “r emo ving
gestur e” from the pr ocess. Ther efore, regar dless of whether using the de veloper constitutes a gestur e, both Whitten and these ar t
historians lik ely agr ee that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. any t ool that a painter uses t o create an ar twork is capable of cr eating gestur es.
B. Whitten ’s work fr om the 1960s exhibits many mor e gestur es than his work fr om the 1970s does.
C. Whitten became less inter ested in exploring the r ole of gestur e in his work as his car eer pr ogressed.
D. Whitten ’s work fr om the 1960s is much mor e realistic than his work fr om the 1970s is.
ID: 9abc3ba5  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer .   Whitten thinks the t ool made “ one gestur e” paintings, while hist orians think the t ool “r emo ved
gestur e” from the pr ocess completely . But putting that debate aside, both Whitten and the hist orians would agr ee that the
paintings he made with the t ool in the ’70s ha ve wa y fewer gestur es than his paintings fr om the ’60s, in which gestur es ar e
“prevalent, ” meaning widely and extensiv ely pr esent.
Choice A is incorr ect. This inf erence isn ’t suppor ted. The text only discusses the “ developer ”—it ne ver mentions other t ools. Choice
C is incorr ect. This inf erence isn ’t suppor ted. If anything, the text suggests the opposite: that Whitten became mor e inter ested in
exploring the r ole of gestur e in his work as his car eer pr ogressed, as his earlier paintings had many gestur es, and his ’70s
paintings only had “ one gestur e.” Choice D is incorr ect. This inf erence isn ’t suppor ted. The text ne ver discusses the “r ealism ” of
Whitten ’s art.

Choice C is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the table t o complete the statement about copper mining.
The table shows the amount of copper mined in each of four countries in 1995 and 2020. Accor ding t o the text, a student who

Choice A is incorr ect because it doesn ’t provide the amount of copper mined in 1995 b y Kazakhstan, the countr y that mined 0.55

ID: 98fd50f2  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t the museum administr ators’
claim that concerns about vir tual t ours r eplacing in-person visits wer e unjustiﬁed. The text explains that after the Galleria
dell’Accademia began off ering online t ours, ther e wer e concerns that if people viewed these vir tual t ours, the y would consider an
in-person visit t o be unnecessar y. The ﬁnding that many visit ors who wer e sur veyed indicated that the vir tual t ours actually
convinced them t o plan an in-person visit dir ectly contr adicts these concerns. Rather than deterring in-person visits, vir tual t ours
activ ely encour aged them, pr oviding str ong suppor t for the administr ators’ claim that the initial concerns wer e unfounded.
Choice B is incorr ect. The ﬁnding that most sur veyed visit ors wer e unawar e of the vir tual t ours befor e their ﬁrst in-person visit
wouldn ’t dir ectly addr ess whether vir tual t ours aff ect decisions about in-person visits. This ﬁnding would only indicate that these
particular visit ors didn ’t ha ve the oppor tunity t o be inﬂuenced b y virtual t ours when making their decision t o visit. Choice C is
incorr ect because the geogr aphic location of visit ors wouldn ’t addr ess the impact of vir tual t ours on people ’s decisions t o visit the
museum in person. Whether visit ors liv e in Flor ence or elsewher e would suggest nothing about whether vir tual t ours inﬂuenced
their choice. This information is irr elevant t o the administr ators’ claim about the r elationship between vir tual t ours and in-person
visits. Choice D is incorr ect because visit ors’ intentions t o view vir tual t ours after their in-person visit wouldn ’t addr ess the initial
concerns that vir tual t ours might mak e in-person visits seem unnecessar y. This ﬁnding indicates that some visit ors plan t o use
virtual t ours as a wa y to remember their visit, but it pr ovides no information about whether vir tual t ours inﬂuenced their decision t o

D. people fr om Scotland abandoned their emphasis on the “r ” sound after r elocating t o the Upland South.
ID: fc57d569  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of English dialects spok en in Scotland and
the Upland South. The text indicates that these dialects shar e a f eatur e: putting emphasis on the "r " sound when it appears in
certain positions in wor ds. The text goes on t o state that r ecor ds indicate the Upland South was coloniz ed lar gely b y people of
Scottish ancestr y. It is r easonable t o assume that the English dialects spok en b y these coloniz ers wer e inﬂuenced b y the English
dialects spok en b y their ancest ors in Scotland. It follows, then, that the emphasis on the "r " sound in the dialects in Scotland
carried o ver int o the Upland South dialects as the y developed—that is, that the Upland South dialects lik ely acquir ed it fr om
dialects spok en in Scotland.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text suggests that Scottish ancestr y explains the origin of the emphasis on the "r " sound in
English dialects spok en in the Upland South, since that linguistic f eatur e is also found in dialects spok en in Scotland; the text
doesn ’t addr ess any other dialects or suggest that the f eatur e will spr ead elsewher e. Choice C is incorr ect because the text
indicates that many Upland South coloniz ers wer e the descendants of Scottish people, suggesting that the English dialects
spok en b y these coloniz ers had been inﬂuenced b y the English dialects spok en b y the coloniz ers’ ancest ors in Scotland and had
acquir ed their emphasis on the "r " sound fr om those ancest ors’ dialects—not the other wa y around. Choice D is incorr ect because
the text indicates that the emphasis on the "r " sound is par t of English dialects spok en in the Upland South t oday, which almost
certainly wouldn ’t be the case if people fr om Scotland, who wer e the main coloniz ers of the Upland South, had eliminated that
linguistic f eatur e from their dialects.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The claim we ’re trying t o prove is that guilds wer e much mor e numer ous r elativ e to population in
some cities than others. This choice describes the guilds per number of inhabitants in two cities (Rouen and P aris), showing
signiﬁcant diff erences between guilds r elativ e to population in these cities.
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice misr eads the table. Bor deaux had 80,000 inhabitants, accor ding t o the table, while L yon had
143,000, so it isn ’t corr ect t o sa y that the y had " nearly equal numbers of inhabitants. " Lyon had almost twice as many inhabitants.
Choice B is incorr ect. This choice misr eads the table. Although L yon did ha ve fewer inhabitants than P aris, it didn ’t ha ve mor e
guilds—P aris had 133 guilds v ersus L yon’s 72. Choice D is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t suppor t the claim. To show that guilds
were mor e numer ous r elativ e to population in some cities than others, we would need t o compar e at least two cities, and this

the description of Vietnamese conv eying information at ar ound the same r ate that Spanish does despite being spok en mor e

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The passage tells us that par ticipants who had seen a less detailed ad for a pr oduct befor ehand had
a higher opinion of the st ore than those who had seen a mor e detailed ad. This suggests that r eactions t o an ad ma y be aff ected
by the amount of detail viewed in pr evious ads.
Choice A is incorr ect. The passage doesn ’t mention the number of people who viewed the ad, so ther e’s no basis for this inf erence.
Choice B is incorr ect. The passage doesn ’t mention the length of time viewing pr evious ads, so ther e’s no basis for this inf erence.
Choice D is incorr ect. The passage doesn ’t mention the time of da y that the ad is viewed, so ther e’s no basis for this inf erence.

The following text is adapted fr om Jack London ’s 1903 no vel The Call of the Wild . Buck is a sled dog living with John Thornt on in
Yukon, Canada.
Thornt on alone held [Buck]. The r est of mankind was as nothing. Chance tr avellers might pr aise or pet him; but he was cold
under it all, and fr om a t oo demonstr ative man he would get up and walk awa y. When Thornt on’s par tners, Hans and P ete,
arriv ed on the long-expected r aft, Buck r efused t o notice them till he learned the y wer e close t o Thornt on; after that he t olerated
them in a passiv e sor t of wa y, accepting fa vors fr om them as though he fa vored them b y accepting.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. Buck has become less social since he began living with Thornt on.
B. Buck mistrusts humans and does his best t o avoid them.
C. Buck has been especially well lik ed b y most of Thornt on’s friends.
D. Buck holds Thornt on in higher r egar d than any other person.
ID: 7ffae38a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. After establishing that Buck views most
people “ as nothing, ” the text explains that Buck won ’t acknowledge people other than Thornt on unless the y appear friendly t owar d
Thornt on, and e ven then he ’s only r eluctantly accepting. Thus, the text focuses on the idea that Thornt on has a special status in
Buck’ s mind, with Buck holding him in higher r egar d than other people.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text conv eys that Buck isn ’t social with people other than Thornt on but doesn ’t addr ess Buck’ s
life or temper ament befor e he liv ed with Thornt on. Choice B is incorr ect because the text conv eys that Buck doesn ’t really car e
about people other than Thornt on and is aloof t owar d them. Howe ver, ther e’s no indication that Buck mistrusts and a voids people
gener ally; indeed, he accepts Thornt on, who is a human. Choice C is incorr ect because the text r efers t o random tr avelers pr aising
and petting Buck and Thornt on’s par tners giving Buck fa vors, but ther e’s no indication that any of these people ar e Thornt on’s
friends or that the y have a par ticular fondness for Buck.

Optical tweez ers ar e specializ ed scientiﬁc t ools—par ticularly useful in biology and medicine—that use high-power ed beams of
light t o trap and manipulate minuscule par ticles for study . Use of the t ool has led t o se veral scientiﬁc and medical br eakthr oughs
over the last f ew decades, but the par ticles ar e often under pr olonged exposur e to the intense heat of the light beams. To
overcome the risk of o verheating, and ther eby damage, r esear chers sometimes attach nano-siz ed glass beads t o par ticles,
allowing the light t o focus on the beads instead of the par ticles.
Based on the text, what is one adv antage of attaching glass beads t o par ticles when using optical tweez ers?
A. It decr eases the time it tak es for the optical tweez ers t o locate and captur e the par ticles.
B. It facilitates the maneuv ering of par ticles without dir ectly heating the par ticles themselv es.
C. It allows r esear chers t o use weak er light beams t o manipulate par ticles.
D. It adds a material t o which par ticles can tr ansf er any heat absorbed fr om the optical tweez ers’ light beam.
ID: 7c9a65bb  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The text sa ys that the glass beads get the "focus" of the light beams so that the par ticles don ’t
overheat. F rom this, we can inf er that the beads allow the par ticles t o be manipulated without being dir ectly heated b y the light
beams.
Choice A is incorr ect. The text ne ver sa ys that attaching the glass beads sa ves time in any wa y. Choice C is incorr ect. The text
never sa ys that attaching the glass beads allows r esear chers t o use weak er light beams. Choice D is incorr ect. The text doesn ’t
say that the par ticles can tr ansf er heat t o the glass beads—r ather , it sa ys the heat fr om the light focuses on the glass beads

Arthurian legends (tales r elated t o the char acter of King Ar thur) deriv e from many sour ces, such as Vita Sancti Cadoci , composed
in the 11th centur y, and Culhwch and Olwen  from the second half of the 12th centur y. One of the most signiﬁcant sour ces,
Geoffr ey of Monmouth ’s History of the Kings of Britain , was written in the 1130s; some material fr om it was later adapted b y the
Norman poet W ace int o the Roman de Brut  in 1155 . But W ace didn ’t mer ely adapt History, he added t o it as well, intr oducing the
famous Round Table at which Ar thur’s knights assembled, which suggests that ______
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A. Roman de Brut  is mor e hist orically accur ate than History, because Culhwch and Olwen  had not been written when Geoffr ey of
Monmouth was writing his work.
B. Geoffr ey of Monmouth was unawar e of st ories of the Round Table when composing his  History, though hist orians know that
works containing such st ories wer e available t o him.
C. Geoffr ey of Monmouth ’s accounts of Ar thurian legends in his  History are mor e similar o verall in content t o the accounts in
Culhwch and Olwen  than the y are to the accounts in Roman de Brut.
D. the Ar thurian legends that the author of Vita Sancti Cadoci  drew on would not ha ve featur ed the Round Table.
ID: 5c7e0d62  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion about the genealogy of Ar thurian legends. The
text establishes a chr onology of Ar thurian sour ces, with Vita Sancti Cadoci  composed in the 11th centur y (the 1000s), Geoffr ey of
Monmouth ’s History written in the 1130s, W ace’s Roman de Brut  in 1155, and Culhwch and Olwen  in the second half of the 12th
centur y (1150–1200). Impor tantly , the text indicates that along with adapting Geoffr ey’s History, Wace added "the famous Round
Table " to it. If W ace intr oduced the idea of the Round Table in 1155, it logically follows that this element was not pr esent in earlier
works. This suggests that the Ar thurian legends that informed Vita Sancti Cadoci , which was written befor e both Geoffr ey’s and
Wace’s works, would not ha ve featur ed the Round Table.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text discusses se veral works that include legends about a char acter , King Ar thur, but doesn ’t
addr ess the hist orical accur acy of the st ories in those works or suggest that the cr eation of Culhwch and Olwen  was r elevant t o
any other works’ accur acy. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that works containing st ories of the Round Table
were available t o Geoffr ey of Monmouth when he composed his History in the 1130s, whether he was awar e of them or not; it
instead suggests that the idea of the Round Table wasn ’t intr oduced until mor e than a decade later , when W ace added it t o
Geoffr ey’s History. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that the Ar thurian legends in Geoffr ey of Monmouth ’s History
differ from those in W ace’s Roman de Brut  in that W ace added the idea of the Round Table, the text doesn ’t compar e the o verall
content of the Ar thurian legends in the two works and doesn ’t indicate anything about the o verall content of the legends in
Culhwch and Olwen .

ID: 299c5303  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . Dramatur ges help pla ywrights with st orytelling and char acterization. Chor eogr aphers often tell st ories
through dance, so the y are also concerned with st orytelling and char acterization. This suggests that the fact that chor eogr aphers
seek the help of dr amatur ges with the st orytelling aspects of their dances should be “unsurprising. ”
Choice A is incorr ect. This inf erence isn ’t suppor ted. The beginning of the text does imply that this is true, but the end is leading t o
a conclusion about how chor eogr aphers use dr amatur ges. Choice C is incorr ect. This inf erence isn ’t suppor ted. The text ne ver

A member of the Ot omi, an Indigenous people in Centr al Mexico, Octa vio Medellín immigr ated t o the United States as a child, and
his sculptur e bears the impr ess of tr aditions on both sides of the bor der: US-based modernist sculptur e, Mexican modernist
painting, Ot omi ar t, and the ancient sculptur e of other Mexican Indigenous peoples, including the Ma ya. In his 1950 masterpiece
History of Mexico , Medellín fuses these inﬂuences int o a style so idiosyncr atic that it r esists effor ts to view his work thr ough the
lens of nationality or cultur al identity . Artists, he insisted, should striv e for individual expr ession, e ven as the y draw inspir ation fr om
their heritage and the communities wher e the y live and work.
Which quotation fr om an ar t critic most dir ectly challenges the underlined claim in the text?
A. “Although a number of ancient Indigenous ar tistic tr aditions pictur ed human forms in pr oﬁle, the forms populating the sur face
of A Hist ory of Mexico  suggest a speciﬁcally Ma ya inﬂuence. ”
B. “In A Hist ory of Mexico , the synthesis of ancient and modernist tr aditions functions as a stylistic par allel t o the work’ s subject
matter: a sur vey of centuries of Mexican hist ory.”
C. “Many critics focus on Indigenous inﬂuences in A Hist ory of Mexico and other k ey works b y Medellín t o the ex clusion of
inﬂuences fr om non-Indigenous ar t.”
D. “While A Hist ory of Mexico featur es modernist motifs, it r elies primarily on angular human forms in pr oﬁle—a staple of Ma ya
sculptur e—and thus invites classiﬁcation as Indigenous ar t.”
ID: 378c66d5  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . This critic challenges the claim b y arguing that A Hist ory of Mexico  is not so idiosyncr atic (unique) as
to resist classiﬁcation because its use of Ma ya-style human pr oﬁles actually “invites classiﬁcation as Indigenous ar t.” Ther efore,
accor ding t o this critic, the work can be viewed, at least par tially , through a lens of national or cultur al identity .
Choice A is incorr ect. While it describes the Ma ya inﬂuence on a par ticular aspect of A Hist ory of Mexico , this quotation doesn ’t
push back on Medellín ’s “idiosyncr atic” (unique) style, nor does it tr y to categoriz e the entir e work int o a single cultur al tradition.
Choice B is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t dir ectly challenge the underlined claim, but r ather suppor ts it. It suggests that the work
effectiv ely blends a v ariety of ar tistic pr oducts t o create a single work that can ’t be deﬁned b y any one tr adition. Instead, the work
recalls many centuries of hist ory and cultur e all at once. Choice C is incorr ect. This choice suppor ts rather than challenges the
underlined claim. The quotation ar gues that other critics focus t oo much on Indigenous inﬂuences on the ar twork instead of
viewing all of the inﬂuences equally—that the y should instead be viewing the work as an idiosyncr atic whole instead of thr ough
one or two narr ow cultur al lenses.

D. would be diﬃcult t o account for if the ﬁgur e is not V enus. 
ID: 5105ca38  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically completes the text’ s discussion about the
signiﬁcance of the cupid found at P ompeii. The text indicates that the cupid is near a statue of a f emale ﬁgur e who is ﬁshing, and
it goes on t o indicate that because V enus is associated with cupids, some scholars belie ve the f emale ﬁgur e to be the goddess
Venus. But the text then sa ys that, accor ding t o archaeologist Carla Br ain, cupids ma y have also been associated with the activity
of ﬁshing, which, if true, would suggest that the mer e appear ance of a cupid near a f emale ﬁgur e engaged in ﬁshing does not
indicate with cer tainty that the ﬁgur e is V enus (that is, the cupid might be associated with ﬁshing, and the ﬁgur e might be any one
at all).
Choice B is incorr ect because the text sa ys nothing about how often V enus was depicted ﬁshing in Roman ar t: it only implies that
in cer tain instances a f emale ﬁgur e ma y or ma y not be V enus. Choice C is incorr ect because Carla Br ain’s proposed explanation
for the pr esence of the cupids mak es no r eference t o the f emale ﬁgur e, and so the possibility that the ﬁgur e in the ar tworks is in
fact V enus cannot be deﬁnitiv ely eliminated. Choice D is incorr ect because ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that the only
reasonable wa y to interpr et the ﬁgur e is as V enus.

Choice D is the best answer . The text describes a study assessing how childr en think of r ewar ds and fairness and its r esults. It
concludes that the childr en in the study ma y have thought that a teacher who counted out loud when giving r ewar ds car ed mor e
about fairness than a teacher who did not count out loud.
Choice A is incorr ect. The childr en in the study ar e described as being “four t o six, ” and the text doesn ’t mention any diff erences

Corr ect A nswer:

Choice A is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses a quotation fr om Happ y House  to illustr ate the claim that the y oung
woman is unimpr essed with the house she is visiting. In the quotation, it sa ys the y oung woman ’s "ﬁrst f eeling was of

beauty in the house suggest that the y oung woman isn ’t impr essed b y the house she is visiting.
Choice B is incorr ect because the quotation doesn ’t describe what the y oung woman thinks about the house. Instead, it indicates
that ther e is mor e light because window blinds ha ve been opened. Choice C is incorr ect because the quotation describes a door
and a path outside of the house but doesn ’t include anything t o indicate the y oung woman ’s feelings about the house. Choice D is

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . We’re told that people needed t o pa y “at least 300 fr ancs in dir ect tax es” t o be able t o vote. W e’re also
told that, while “r elativ ely few people paid the tax on r eal estate, ” real estate tax es wer e both the main wa y people qualiﬁed t o vote

signiﬁcant F rench r eal estate holdings.
Choice B is incorr ect. The passage doesn ’t mention the v oting habits of ar tisans and mer chants nor any r eduction in tax bur dens
on businesses, so ther e’s no basis for this inf erence. Choice C is incorr ect. Although we know that doors and windows wer e tax ed

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about how the Lor d Chancellor r esponds t o the cr owd that is
suppor ted b y the text. The text indicates that the people in the cr owd ar e roaring and shouting “Br ead!” or “T axes!” and pr esents
them as not knowing what the y really want. The Lor d Chancellor ’s response is t o ask what their shouting means but also t o
obser ve that the y’re shouting with “unanimity ,” or t otal agr eement. Clearly , this isn ’t the case, which suppor ts the statement that
the Lor d Chancellor describes the cr owd as being united e ven though it’ s not. 
Choice A is incorr ect because it isn ’t suppor ted b y the text. Although the text indicates that the Lor d Chancellor asks about the
meaning of the cr owd’ s shouting, it doesn ’t suggest that he knows what the cr owd r eally wants. Choice B is incorr ect because the
text doesn ’t suggest that the Lor d Chancellor wants t o speak t o the cr owd. F urthermor e, the text doesn ’t indicate that the cr owd
wants t o hear fr om the Sub-W arden. Although the cr owd r oars when ask ed “Who r oar for the Sub-W arden?” it’ s unclear what the
roaring means. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that the Lor d Chancellor knows of or sympathiz es with the

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Ana Castillo ’s 1986 no vel The
Mixquiahuala Letters . The text states that the no vel consists entir ely of letters fr om the narr ator to her friend—a format that some
students r eading the no vel in a class found intimidating. Accor ding t o the text, those students also found the no vel’s treatment of
gender t o be old-fashioned. In r esponse t o the students’ concerns, their pr ofessor emphasiz ed the no vel’s relevance: it’ s written in

Choice A is incorr ect because the pr ofessor ’s response t o the students only mentions The Mix quiahuala Letters : it doesn ’t

Recently , scientists look ed at data collected b y NASA’s InSight lander t o learn mor e about seismic activity on Mars, known as
marsquak es. The data show that the marsquak es all star ted fr om the same location on the planet. This disco very was surprising
to scientists, as the y expected that the marsquak es would originate fr om all o ver the planet because of the cooling of the planet’ s
surface. Now , scientists belie ve that ther e could be ar eas of activ e magma ﬂows deep beneath the planet’ s sur face that trigger the
marsquak es.  
Accor ding t o the text, what was surprising t o scientists studying the seismic activity data fr om N ASA’s InSight lander?
A. The sur face temper ature of Mars has been rising. 
B. Ther e wer e diff erent types of seismic wa ves causing marsquak es.
C. NASA’s InSight lander collected less data than scientists had expected. 
D. All the marsquak es star ted fr om the same location on the planet.
ID: c188a397  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about what surprised the scientists that is suppor ted b y the text. The
text states that the marsquak es described in the data fr om N ASA’s InSight lander originated fr om the same location on Mars. The
text goes on t o sa y that because the y had expected the opposite (that marsquak es would originate fr om all o ver the planet) this
disco very surprised the scientists.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t say that the data fr om N ASA’s InSight lander r evealed any surprising information
about the planet’ s sur face temper ature. Instead, the text mentions the cooling of Mars’ s sur face as a r eason the scientists
expected that marsquak es had multiple origins. In addition, cooling would indicate that the temper ature has been falling r ather
than rising. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that b y studying seismic activity scientists found a possible
explanation for what causes marsquak es, the text doesn ’t say that the y disco vered that marsquak es ar e caused b y diff erent types
of seismic wa ves. Rather , the text states that based on the data fr om N ASA’s InSight lander , scientists now belie ve that this
seismic activity happens because of ar eas of activ e magma that ﬂow below the planet’ s sur face. Choice C is incorr ect because
the text doesn ’t discuss the amount of data N ASA’s InSight lander collected or whether scientists who studied the data found the
amount t o be as expected. Instead, the text focuses on what the data r evealed about wher e on Mars the marsquak es originated.

ID: ee41d7e0  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text states that r esear chers ha ve
used fossils t o learn about the ner vous systems of ancient ar thropods. It then pr ovides a speciﬁc example of r esear chers studying
fossils of Mollisonia symmetrica  and ﬁnding e vidence of a ner ve cor d and possibly a synganglion (a br ain-lik e mass of ner ves).
The text concludes b y noting that r esear chers hope t o disco ver mor e featur es of pr ehist oric ar thropods’ ner vous systems " as
additional fossils ar e found. " Thus, the main idea of the text is that fossil e vidence can contribute t o the understanding of the
nervous system in ancient ar thropods.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t compar e the br ains of hawk moths and brine shrimp. These animals ar e mer ely
mentioned as examples of ar thropods in the opening sentence, and the text doesn ’t go on t o discuss any similarities between their
brains. Choice C is incorr ect because the text discusses ner vous systems, not spines, in ancient ar thropods, and it doesn ’t
speciﬁcally mention ﬁndings about ancient hawk moths or brine shrimp. Choice D is incorr ect. While the text concludes b y noting
that r esear chers aim t o disco ver additional char acteristics of pr ehist oric ar thropods’ ner vous systems as mor e fossils ar e
unco vered, this statement doesn ’t suggest that r esear chers need t o focus on ﬁnding mor e fossils. Rather , it simply indicates that
resear chers expect t o learn mor e about this t opic as additional fossils ar e disco vered. Mor eover, the statement is just a detail that

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely illustr ates the claim in the text that Hedda seeks t o inﬂuence another
char acter ’s fate. In the quotation, Hedda sa ys that she wants “t o ha ve power t o mould a human destiny ,” or shape a person ’s fate,
just as the text indicates. Additionally , the phr ase “for once in my lif e” suggests that Hedda f eels that she has ne ver been able t o
shape any one’s life, including her own, suppor ting the text’ s asser tion that she “is unable t o freely determine her own futur e.”
Choice A is incorr ect because this quotation shows Hedda being uncer tain about what t o do with her own lif e, not wanting t o
inﬂuence another person ’s fate. Choice C is incorr ect because while this quotation shows Hedda ’s inter est in ﬁnding out whether
she has any power o ver another char acter , it doesn ’t clearly show that she wants t o inﬂuence that person ’s fate. In this quotation,
Hedda seems t o ha ve inf erred or concluded (“then ”) that she doesn ’t ha ve any inﬂuence o ver the person t o whom she ’s speaking,
and she ’s asking that person t o conﬁrm her lack of inﬂuence. Choice D is incorr ect because this quotation expr esses Hedda ’s

Choice C is the best answer because it eff ectiv ely uses data fr om the table t o complete the example of the estimated impact of
invasive mongooses on thr eatened mammals. The table shows the v alues for the estimated harmful impact of thr ee inv asive

In the 1970s, a r oughly 60,000-y ear-old piece of hy ena bone mark ed with nine notches was disco vered at a site in western F rance
once inhabited b y Neander thals. Although many belie ve that only modern humans de veloped systems for notating numbers, one
archaeologist asser ts that this ar tifact ma y be a sign that Neander thals also r ecor ded numerical information. The notches on the
bone ar e une venly spaced but appr oximately par allel, and micr oscopic analysis r eveals that the y wer e made with a single st one
tool; accor ding t o the ar chaeologist, this suggests that the notches wer e all made at one time b y one individual as a means of
counting something.
Which ﬁnding, if true, would most dir ectly weak en the underlined claim?
A. Parallel lines ar e a common f eatur e in modern humans’ early systems for r ecor ding numerical information.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The ar cheologist bases their claim on the fact that the hy ena bone f eatur es une venly spaced par allel
notches. But if une venly spaced par allel lines wer e found on " decor ative art" at another Neander thal site, it would suggest that the
hyena bone is pr obably decor ative art as well—not a counting t ool.
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t weak en the underlined claim. If anything, it might actually str engthen the claim:
assuming we can mak e an inf erence about Neander thals using a fact about early humans, it pr ovides mor e suppor t for the idea
that the person who made the notches was counting something. Choice B is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t weak en the underlined
claim. The fact that another ar tifact had par allel notches made with a diff erent st one t ool doesn ’t tell us anything about the use of
either ar tifact. F or all we know , they could both ha ve been used for counting. Choice C is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t weak en the

Furthermor e, the text suggests that Gibbon is Holme ’s favorite author because, as the text states, "he was alwa ys reading Gibbon. "
Thus, Holme would ha ve felt anno yed at ha ving been interrupted when the letter was deliv ered.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that Holme is r elieved to receiv e the letter . Instead, the text states that
Holme "just glanced indiff erently at the letter ," suggesting that the letter wasn ’t impor tant t o him. Choice B is incorr ect because the

in China: those fr om nor th China (Mandarin speak ers) typically settle in Queens, while those fr om south China (Cant onese or

Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t discuss r ates of language change. The text indicates that many languages ar e

Choice B is the best answer because the quotation fr om The Souls of Black F olk illustr ates the claim that Du Bois f elt a sense of

The following text is Vita Sackville-W est’s cir ca 1920 poem “E vening. ” Spars ar e ships’ masts, moorings ar e ropes that hold dock ed
ships in place, and a riding-light is a light that a ship shines when it is anchor ed.
When little lights in little por ts come out,
Quiv ering down thr ough water with the stars,
And all the ﬁshing ﬂeet of slender spars
Range at their moorings, v eer with tide about;
 
When r ace of wind is stilled and sails ar e furled,
And underneath our single riding-light
The cur ve of black-ribbed deck gleams palely white,
And slumbr ous waters pool a slumbr ous world;
 
—Then, and then only , have I thought how sweet
Old age might sink upon a windy y outh,
Quiet beneath the riding-light of truth,
Weather ed thr ough st orms, and gr acious in r etreat.
Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A. The tr anquility of a por t in the e vening can incline a person t o appr eciate the stillness of old age.
B. The diﬃculty of bringing a ship int o por t is apt tr aining for dealing with the types of struggles encounter ed in old age.

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it best states the main idea of the text. The speak er describes an e vening scene obser ved
from a boat: "little lights in little por ts come out" and ar e reﬂected in the water ’s sur face " with the stars, " ﬁshing boats ar e moor ed,
"sails ar e furled" (r olled up), and the riding-light is shining. The speak er emphasiz es the calmness of the scene, noting that the
"race of wind is stilled" and the atmospher e is sleep y ("slumbr ous waters pool a slumbr ous world"), and then indicates that the
calmness pr ompts thoughts of how old age might be " sweet" and " quiet" and " gracious in r etreat" after " a windy y outh " with
"storms. " Thus, the main idea is that the tr anquility of a por t in the e vening can lead a person t o appr eciate the potential stillness of
old age.
Choice B is incorr ect because the speak er isn ’t discussing the diﬃculty of bringing a ship int o por t but describing the calmness of
the por t at night. And r ather than suggesting that old age inv olves struggles, the speak er suggests that after " a windy y outh " with
"storms" t o be weather ed, old age will be " sweet, " "quiet, " and " gracious"—that is, old age will be tr anquil lik e a por t at night. Choice
C is incorr ect because the speak er isn ’t suggesting that a person who has liv ed a v aried and activ e life might ﬁnd it diﬃcult t o sta y
in a calm place in old age. On the contr ary, the speak er suggests that after a " windy y outh " with " storms, " old age can be welcomed
as something " sweet, " "quiet, " and " gracious, " just lik e a calm por t at night. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the speak er does t ouchAssessment

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text based on suppor ting data in the gr aph. The text indicates
that in the ﬂy D. melanogaster , DptA  and DptB  are genes that encode peptides that both ﬁght pathogens and pr omote beneﬁcial
micr obes. Resear chers tested D. melanogaster ’s resistance t o P. rettgeri  and A. sicer ae bacteria based on which v ariation of the
peptide-encoding gene the ﬂies exhibit: DptA  silenced (r eferred to as type A), DptB  silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB).
The text also indicates that r esistance t o P. rettgeri  corr elates with DptA  activity but not with DptB  activity (which would manif est
as type B ﬂies sur viving at a higher r ate than other ﬂy types when exposed t o P. rettgeri ). The gr aph shows the post– A. sicer ae
infection r esults, which indicate that DptB  activity was most str ongly associated with sur vival, wher eas DptA  activity was not

activity was silenced, the ﬂies showed r elativ ely high sur vival rates, but when DptB  activity was silenced, whether on its own or in
conjunction with DptA  activity being silenced, sur vival rates wer e low , suggesting that DptB  may have de veloped as a speciﬁc
defense against A. sicer ae.
Choice A is incorr ect. The gr aph suggests that DptA  activity is associated with a low r ate of sur vival, not a high one. F urthermor e,
the gr aph shows r esults for ﬂies wher e DptA  alone was silenced, DptB  alone was silenced, and both wer e silenced and thus does
not show any ﬂies with activity in both DptA  and DptB , which would be necessar y to determine whether DptA conf erred def ense
against A. sicer ae in the pr esence of  DptB . Choice B is incorr ect. Only two bacteria species wer e consider ed in the text: P. rettgeri
and A. sicer ae. The text and gr aph tak en together suggest that activity in DptA  is associated with r esistance t o P. rettgeri  while
DptB  activity is not, and that DptB  activity is associated with r esistance t o A. sicer ae while DptA  is not. Ther e is no fur ther

Given that stars and planets initially form fr om the same gas and dust in space, some astr onomers ha ve posited that host stars
(such as the Sun) and their planets (such as those in our solar system) ar e composed of the same materials, with the planets
containing equal or smaller quantities of the materials that mak e up the host star . This idea is also suppor ted b y evidence that
rocky planets in our solar system ar e composed of some of the same materials as the Sun.

ID: 0045c234  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would weak en the astr onomers’ claim about the mak eup of
host stars and their planets. The text explains that because stars and planets begin forming fr om the same gas and dust,
astronomers belie ve planets should be composed of the same materials as their host stars, but in equal or smaller quantities. The
ﬁnding that the amount of ir on in some r ocky planets is much higher than the amount in their host star would weak en the
astronomers’ claim because it would show that some planets contain the same material as their host star , but in higher quantities.
Choice A is incorr ect because a ﬁnding only about the mak eup of stars, whether the y’ve cooled or not, would pr ovide no
information about the mak eup of planets. Thus, it wouldn ’t ha ve any bearing on the claim that planets and their host stars ar e
composed of the same materials in diff ering quantities. Choice B is incorr ect because a ﬁnding about two host stars ha ving
similar pr opor tions of cer tain materials wouldn ’t provide any information about the mak eup of planets. Thus, it wouldn ’t be
relevant t o the claim that planets and their host stars ar e composed of the same materials in diff ering quantities. Choice D is
incorr ect because the text indicates that the astr onomers’ claim is based on a fact—that stars and planets begin forming fr om the
same gas and dust in space—which would r emain true r egar dless of the eff ectiv eness of a method for analysis of compositions.
The text does cite analysis of r ocky planets in our solar system and the Sun, but only as a single piece of e vidence that is
consistent with the claim and not as the sour ce of the claim; the ﬁnding that the method used for that analysis is less eff ectiv e in
other scenarios wouldn ’t weak en a claim that’ s based on knowledge of how stars and planets initially form.

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that fashion r etailers
face challenges in for ecasting pr oduct demand due t o rapidly changing tastes and lengthy manufacturing times. It then pr esents
resear ch b y Fu and Fisher showing that combining r etailers’ own data with social media information signiﬁcantly impr oves

overstocked. Thus, the main idea is that using multiple data sour ces (r etailers’ own data combined with social media information)
can enhance fashion r etailers’ ability t o anticipate demand.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t claim that social media is r evolutionizing, or fundamentally changing, how sellers
and r esear chers view the fashion industr y. The text ne ver addr esses the wa y the fashion industr y is viewed; r ather , it discusses a
practical appr oach sellers in the industr y can tak e to better match pr oduction with demand. Choice C is incorr ect. Although
avoiding o verstocking is mentioned as a beneﬁt of an appr oach that can help fashion sellers better pr edict demand, the text
doesn ’t focus on o verstocking or char acteriz e it as the main concern of sellers. Rather , the text is focused on discussing the
appr oach itself. Choice D is incorr ect because the text suggests that fashion sellers encounter obstacles when using their own

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of consumer expectations and the struggles

to struggle with last-mile logistics. " The text fur ther explains that inno vations aimed at addr essing this challenge ha ve a tendency
to cause complications of their own. Because escalating consumer demands for speed ar e pair ed with persistent, complex
deliv ery obstacles and new pr oblems arising fr om attempted solutions, it logically follows that consumer expectations for deliv ery

Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t addr ess the idea of deliv ery volumes at all and mak es it clear that companies ar e

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main idea of the text. The text begins b y explaining that wild
animals can be studied in their natur al habitat or in a labor atory setting, with each setting off ering unique adv antages t o
resear chers. The text then highlights an instance in which W estern scrub-ja ys wer e studied in both settings but with conﬂicting
results, indicating that one or both studies ma y have failed t o account for the disadv antages of its r esear ch setting. Thus, the main
idea of the text is that while wild animals can be eff ectiv ely studied in natur al or lab settings, ther e are drawbacks t o each that
need t o be consider ed to ensur e accur ate r esults.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text does not position one study setting (natur al or lab) as superior t o the other; r ather , the text
states that each one has adv antages o ver the other . Choice B is incorr ect. The text pr ovides a hypothetical example of two studies
in diff erent envir onments with conﬂicting r esults, but this single example cannot be extr apolated t o a gener al claim about the
likelihood that r esults of studies in diff erent envir onments will conﬂict. Additionally , the text does not asser t anything about how
resear chers can or cannot r esolv e conﬂicting study r esults. Choice D is incorr ect because the text does not state that
discr epancies between natur al-habitat and lab-based animal beha vior studies ar e due t o both of the designs being ﬂawed. Rather ,
the text states that the conﬂict in r esults can be the consequence of one or both of the studies ha ving failed t o account for some
factor.

ID: 3f7f35ea  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely uses a quotation fr om "The Bet" t o illustr ate the claim that the bank er was
very upset about something. The quotation indicates that the bank er shed tears, which suggests that he was lik ely unhapp y about
something, and that his emotions wer e so str ong that the y kept him fr om sleeping for hours. These details suggest that the bank er
was v ery upset.
Choice A is incorr ect because this quotation mainly describes the bank er cautiously unlocking a door; it doesn ’t suggest that he
was par ticularly upset about anything. Choice B is incorr ect because this quotation doesn ’t mention whether the bank er was
experiencing any par ticularly str ong negativ e feelings; instead, the quotation focuses on the quietness of the setting. Choice C is
incorr ect because this quotation states that the bank er was f eeling " delighted, " not that he was upset.

Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents the quotation that most eff ectiv ely illustr ates the claim that the speak er of the
poem describes experiencing an ongoing cy cle of anticipation followed b y regretful r eﬂection. In this quotation, the speak er notes
that as y ears go b y, “Each, coming”—that is, each new y ear as it comes—“brings ambitions high. ” In other wor ds, the speak er
begins each new y ear with lar ge goals. But the speak er goes on t o sa y that as each y ear ends (“ each, depar ting”), it “lea ves a sigh
/ Link ed to the past. ” A sigh is an expr ession of longing or r egret, so in the context of the whole quotation, this por tion suggests
that at the end of each y ear, the speak er regretfully r eﬂects on not ha ving achie ved the ambitions formed at the beginning of the
year. The phr ases “the y ears go swiftly b y,” “Each, coming, ” and “ each, depar ting” indicate that this experience happens o ver and
over again: the speak er experiences a cy cle of anticipation followed b y regretful r eﬂection. 
Choice A is incorr ect because this quotation does not describe an ongoing cy cle of anticipation followed b y regretful r eﬂection.
Instead, the speak er describes experiencing a sensation similar t o fright as a r esult of something that has occurr ed at midnight.
Speciﬁcally , the speak er has hear d a “br azen tongue, ” a ﬁgur ative wa y of sa ying that the speak er has hear d the clang of a br onze
bell being rung. Choice B is incorr ect because although this quotation does conv ey a sense of anticipation thr ough its r eference t o
“ominous stillness, ” ther e is no suggestion of r egretful r eﬂection or any indication that the speak er is describing an ongoing cy cle
of anticipation followed b y such r eﬂection. Instead, the speak er is describing a par ticular moment when a winter st orm appears t o
have momentarily calmed. Choice C is incorr ect because although this quotation does conv ey a sense of r egret (“many a

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would suppor t the scholar ’s claim about Toni Morrison ’s
likely goal of str engthening the pr esence of Black writers on Random House ’s list of published authors. The text explains that
Morrison was the ﬁrst Black woman t o be an edit or for Random House and that she was an edit or ther e from 1967 t o 1983. If it
were true that Random House published a higher per centage of works b y Black authors thr oughout the 1970s—during most of
Morrison ’s time working ther e—than it had pr eviously published, that would suggest that Morrison ma y have made a deliber ate
effor t to str engthen the pr esence of Black authors on the list of Random House ’s published authors, thus suppor ting the scholar ’s
claim.
Choice B is incorr ect because the scholar ’s claim is about Morrison ’s work as an edit or at a publishing company and her lik ely
effor t to str engthen the pr esence of Black writers on that company ’s list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors
inter viewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison ’s no vels as an inﬂuence on their work, but that ﬁnding would simply
suggest something about how those authors appr oached their work; it wouldn ’t show that Morrison intended t o incr ease the
number of Black writers among the published authors speciﬁcally at Random House. Choice C is incorr ect because the scholar ’s
claim is about Morrison ’s work as an edit or at a publishing company , not about her work as a no velist. Ther efore, a ﬁnding that
Morrison ’s no vels published after 1983 sold mor e copies and wer e mor e widely acclaimed than her earlier no vels would ha ve no
bearing on the claim that as an edit or Morrison made an effor t to ensur e that mor e Black writers wer e present on Random House ’s
list of published authors. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text discusses Morrison ’s work as an edit or at Random House, the
scholar ’s claim focuses on Morrison ’s likely effor t in that r ole t o incr ease the number of Black writers pr esent on Random House ’s
list of published authors, not on the inﬂuence she ma y have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether
Morrison ’s stylistic inﬂuence led t o mor e publications or if Morrison applied her inﬂuence speciﬁcally t o works b y Black writers, the
ﬁnding that works edited b y Morrison could be identiﬁed b y stylistic char acteristics would ha ve no bearing on the claim that

Conv entional theories of rhet oric hold that pr esenting information as coming fr om cr edentialed exper ts incr eases that

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of how
participants consider ed messages fr om former trial v olunteers and doct ors. The text ﬁrst establishes that information coming
from cr edentialed exper ts typically incr eases the cr edibility of that information. Howe ver, the text goes on t o describe a situation
that goes against this expectation: the messages fr om pr evious trial v olunteers wer e judged as mor e credible than the messages
from licensed doct ors when r ecruiting clinic trial par ticipants. The text then goes on t o speculate as t o why this ma y have been the
case, stating that par ticipants lik ely consider ed the messages fr om the former trial v olunteers t o be mor e convincing than the
messages fr om the doct ors because the former trial v olunteers wer e per ceived as ha ving under gone the same experience that the
participants wer e considering. It is r easonable t o inf er, then, that par ticipants r egar ded the former trial v olunteers’ dir ect
experience as mor e impor tant t o their decision-making than the doct ors’ status as cr edentialed exper ts.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text does not pr ovide any indication as t o the content or the t one of the messages pr ovided b y
either the doct ors or the former trial v olunteers r egar ding the clinical trials. Choice B is incorr ect. Since the study par ticipants had
not themselv es par ticipated in the clinical trial, the y could not r ely on their experience t o evaluate the cr edibility of either the
former trial v olunteers or the doct ors. Choice D is incorr ect. While the text does establish that the par ticipants lik ely consider ed
the messages fr om both the doct ors and the former trial v olunteers, it does not suggest that the par ticipants doubted the doct ors’
credentials. Rather , the text speculates that par ticipants ma y have giv en the experiences of the former trial v olunteers mor e

ID: cae97f58  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because  it most logically completes the text. The text explains that while deser t moss species need
suﬃcient sunlight for phot osynthesis, exposur e to sunlight can also aff ect the plants negativ ely b y drying them out. Ekwealor and
Fisher ’s team found specimens of S. caniner vis moss gr owing under quar tz cr ystals that wer e semitr anspar ent, allowing some but
not all sunlight t o pass thr ough them, and the shoot tissue of these specimens was longer than that of S. caniner vis specimens
found gr owing on the sur face that wer e unpr otected b y such cr ystals. Since, as the text explains, the length of shoot tissue is an
indicat or of plant gr owth, and since gr eater exposur e to sunlight r esults in gr eater loss of moistur e, it can be inf erred that S.
caniner vis growing under quar tz cr ystals experience lower light intensity and ar e thus able t o retain mor e moistur e.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mention another moss species besides S. caniner vis or discuss whether other such
species ar e able t o grow under tr anspar ent cr ystals, as S. caniner vis is. Choice B is incorr ect because, as the text explains,
specimens of S. caniner vis were found gr owing under quar tz cr ystals and exhibited mor e plant gr owth than specimens gr owing on

phot osynthesis. Choice D is incorr ect. The text contr asts the gr owth of S. caniner vis specimens found beneath semitr anspar ent
quar tz cr ystals with that of specimens found on the soil sur face absent such cr ystals, but it doesn ’t mak e a comparison among

Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about how Richar d Wagner achie ved moments of extr emely high

overall volume of the or chestr a could be dr amatically incr eased at k ey moments in W agner ’s oper as.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text ne ver indicates that W agner mo ved his oper as indoors t o achie ve moments of extr emely
high v olume, nor does it indicate that his oper as wer e previously per formed outdoors. The only technique discussed in the text for
achie ving extr emely high v olume is W agner ’s addition of mor e instruments t o create a bigger , louder or chestr a. Choice C is

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that would best suppor t Granito and Álv arez’s claim that f ermenting
black beans mak es them easier t o digest and mor e nutritious. The text indicates that high le vels of soluble ﬁber and r aﬃnose in

Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that tr ypsin inhibit ors and tannins inter fere with the body ’s ability t o extr act
nutrients fr om black beans; if f ermentation and cooking wer e found t o incr ease these antinutrients, f ermented beans would lik ely
be less nutritious than unf ermented ones, not mor e nutritious (as Gr anito and Álv arez claim). Choice C is incorr ect because the

ID: 65502c46  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it logically completes the text’ s discussion of the r ole of gift giving among members of guilds
in early modern London. Accor ding t o the text, members of these guilds par ticipated in a cultur e wher e giving gifts "both signaled
and conf erred social status"—that is, it indicated people ’s social standing and also ga ve them social standing—and occurr ed in the
forms of both philanthr opic gifting (donations for humanitarian purposes) b y large guilds, which much r esear ch has focused on,
and the gifting of handmade items between cr aft guild members, which Kilburn-T oppin focuses on. The text indicates that Kilburn-
Toppin char acteriz es cr aft guild members as people who made and consumed items and wer e "highly discerning, " or wer e car eful
judges of quality . Because gift giving beneﬁted one ’s status and if cr aft guild members wer e par ticularly attentiv e to quality , it
follows that gifting handmade items within the guilds—between people who had high standar ds for items the y made and for items
they receiv ed—ma y have been a wa y for members t o maintain and enhance their pr ofessional r eputations, or their pr ofessional
statuses, among their peers.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text emphasiz es the idea that members of guilds par ticipated in gift giving both t o displa y and
receiv e social status, suggesting that the gifting of handmade items between the "highly discerning" members of cr aft guilds had
to do with the members’ inter est in quality and status; nothing in the text suggests that the pr actice of gifting those items within
the cr aft guilds was intended t o limit knowledge of materials and techniques t o the members of those guilds. Choice B is incorr ect
because the text doesn ’t distinguish between " ostentatious, " or v ery showy , and " prosaic, " or or dinar y, gifts and because the
char acterization at the end of the text per tains speciﬁcally t o the gifting of handmade items indicativ e of gr eat taste, not pr osaic
items, between members of cr aft guilds. And while the text indicates that London ’s lar gest guilds ga ve philanthr opic gifts
(donations for humanitarian purposes), it doesn ’t indicate whether these gifts would ha ve been consider ed ostentatious. Choice D
is incorr ect because the char acterization pr esented at the end of the text per tains speciﬁcally t o the "highly discerning" members
of cr aft guilds giving their handmade items as gifts t o one another within the cr aft guilds; the text doesn ’t suggest anything about
gifting those items t o members of London ’s lar gest guilds or how that might aff ect status diff erently fr om giving them t o other

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately uses data fr om the table t o complete the statement about cer tain r otating
radio tr ansients (RRA Ts). The table contains information about the right ascensions, periods, and fr equencies of v arious pulsar
stars called RRA Ts. Accor ding t o the text, the period of an RRA T is deﬁned as the time between consecutiv e pulses. The table
shows that the period of RRA T J0614-03 is 0.136 seconds, which is the lowest number of all the periods of the RRA Ts listed in the
table. If the period is the time between consecutiv e pulses, and J0614-03 has the shor test period, then J0614-03 has the shor test
amount of time between consecutiv e pulses of all the RRA Ts in the table.
Choice B is incorr ect because accor ding t o the table, J0545-03 has a period of 1.074 seconds and J0121+53 has a period of 2.725
seconds. Accor ding t o the text, the period of an RRA T is the time between consecutiv e pulses. Ther efore, since J0545-03 and
J0121+53 ha ve diff erent periods, the y do not ha ve the same amount of time between consecutiv e pulses. Choice C is incorr ect
because accor ding t o the table, J1654-2335 has a period of 0.545 seconds, which is not the longest period of all the RRA Ts listed
in the table. Accor ding t o the text, the period of an RRA T is the time between consecutiv e pulses, and both J0545-03 and
J0121+53 ha ve longer periods than J1654-2335, so J1654-2335 does not ha ve the longest time between consecutiv e pulses of all
the RRA Ts in the table. Choice D is incorr ect because accor ding t o the table, J0103+54 has a period of 0.354 seconds, and
J0121+53 has a period of 2.725 seconds. Accor ding t o the text, the period of an RRA T is the time between consecutiv e pulses,

Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a ﬁnding that, if true, would most dir ectly suppor t Barbo za and Trejos’ s claim that
rural female entr epreneurs who ha ve receiv ed small loans fr om ALSOL ar e str ategic in selling their goods less fr equently than the y

and Trejos found that rur al borr owers miss weekly pa yments in par t because the y don ’t sell their goods as often as the y could, a
move the r esear chers claim allows the entr epreneurs t o help incr ease pr oﬁts for the goods the y sell. Finding that the cost of
bringing goods t o towns with mark etplaces is high for rur al entr epreneurs but is lar gely independent of how many goods ar e
brought would suppor t the r esear chers’ claim: tr aveling t o mark etplaces less fr equently would mean that a rur al entr epreneur
spends less on tr avel overall, and taking a lar ge load of goods t o a mark etplace for essentially the same cost as taking a small
load would allow the entr epreneur t o mor e substantially offset the cost of tr avel with gr eater o verall sales at the mark etplace,
resulting in mor e proﬁt per good sold—e ven if those pr oﬁts ar e earned less fr equently and don ’t suppor t weekly loan pa yments.
Choice A is incorr ect because the ﬁnding that many mark etplaces r equir e entr epreneurs t o pa y the oper ators of the mark etplace a

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the sediments found at the Gale Cr ater’s
Murr ay Formation on Mars. The text states that data gather ed b y the Curiosity  rover suggest that bodies of water deposited
sediment on Mars’ s sur face long ago. The text goes on t o sa y that studying the sediment, Riv era-Hernández et al. found some
coarse gr ains the y belie ve are sandst one, which tends t o be left b y ﬂowing water , and many mor e ﬁne gr ains the y belie ve are
mudst one, which tends t o slowly sink in low-ﬂow water . The text fur ther indicates that the r esear chers noted cr acks in the ﬁne
grains that suggest ther e wer e cycles of desiccation, or dr ying, at the site. Taken together , this information suggests that a lak e (a
body of low-ﬂow water) existed at the site for a pr olonged period but occasionally experienced dr ying and that ther e wer e periods
in which one or mor e str eams (ﬂowing water) wer e present, since the extended existence of a lak e would account for the
abundance of ﬁne gr ains, periods of dr ying would account for the cr acks in the ﬁne gr ains, and periods with str eams would
account for the sections of coarse gr ains.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that an abundance of ﬁne gr ains of sediment was found at the Murr ay Formation
site, which suggests that a low-ﬂow water sour ce (such as a lak e) was present. F urther, the text mak es no mention of wher e the
water at the site ma y have originated fr om. Choice C is incorr ect because the e vidence described in the text doesn ’t suppor t the
idea that ther e wer e str eams at the Murr ay Formation for an extended period and a lak e for just a shor t time. The abundance of
ﬁne gr ains suggests that a lak e (a body of low-ﬂow water) was pr esent for an extended time, not just a shor t time, and the
sections of coarse gr ains suggest that one or mor e str eams (bodies of ﬂowing water) wer e intermittently pr esent while the lak e

lake) and ﬂowing water (such as str eams) existed at the Murr ay Formation site, meaning that ther e could ha ve been a str eam-f ed
lake, the text explains that the ﬁne gr ains that signify the pr esence of a lak e exhibit cr acking that indicates periods of desiccation,

some ar chaeologists t o worr y that their own work won ’t be needed any longer . If sur vey results indicate that categorizing potter y
fragments limits the amount of time ar chaeologists can dedicate t o other impor tant tasks that only human exper ts can do, that
would mean that computer models ar en’t able t o do all of the impor tant things ar chaeologists do, thus suppor ting the r esear chers’
claim that computer models ar e unlik ely to replace human ar chaeologists.
Choice A is incorr ect because if it wer e true that the computer model could categoriz e the potter y fragments much mor e quickly

Choice B is the best answer because it pr esents the conclusion that most logically follows fr om the text’ s discussion of the
relationship between the AA CM’s use of ment ors t o suppor t young Black musicians and similar suppor t that other or ganizations
offer their y oung ar tists. Accor ding t o the text, in ser vice of AA CM’s goal t o suppor t new works b y Black musicians, AA CM

young ar tists t o learn fr om ment ors who ar e established in their ﬁeld.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that technical tr aining is mor e beneﬁcial than cr eativ e guidance. The text
states that AA CM ment ors off er both technical tr aining and cr eativ e guidance t o young ar tists and that other ar ts or ganizations
offer similar kinds of suppor t; howe ver, nothing in the text suggests that y oung ar tists, or ar tists of any age, beneﬁt mor e from
technical tr aining. Choice C is incorr ect because the text is mainly concerned with the fact that established ar tists ar e ment oring
young ar tists thr ough AA CM and other ar ts or ganizations. The text states that y oung musicians beneﬁt fr om AA CM ment ors but
does not addr ess what ment ors gain fr om the r elationship, so ther e is no r eason t o conclude that most established ar tists could

Choice B is the best answer . Since r esin casting “ine vitably r equir es destr oying the burr ow,” it would be impossible t o mak e

ID: b1fab3e1  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the sound quality of Cr emonese and
modern violins. The text states that violins made in Cr emona in the sixteenth t o eighteenth centuries sound superior t o modern
violins. It then indicates that some exper ts attribute the diff erence t o diff erent woods being used t o mak e these violins, but both
Cremonese and modern violins ar e made of the same woods (maple and spruce); thus this cannot account for the diff erence. The
text then sa ys that r ecent analysis suggests the wood in Cr emonese violins was chemically tr eated b y the cr aftspeople who made
them, ther eby providing an alternate explanation for the sound diff erences: the chemical alter ation that is pr esent in the
Cremonese violins but absent fr om the modern ones.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text does not discuss how the sound quality of Cr emonese violins compar es with the sound
quality of other instruments made during the sixteenth t o eighteenth centuries. Instead it focuses on how the sound of the
Cremonese violins compar es with that of modern violins. Choice C is incorr ect. The text states that ther e are diff erences in sound
quality between the Cr emonese and modern violins, and that both types of violin ar e made with maple or spruce. Thus the type of
wood alone does not determine a violin ’s sound quality . Furthermor e, even if the type of wood alone could account for diff erences
in sound quality , the text mak es no mention of other woods, so ther e is no basis t o judge how modern violins would sound if the y
were made using woods besides maple and spruce. Choice D is incorr ect because the text states that ther e is e vidence that
Cremonese cr aftspeople chemically tr eated the wood used in Cr emonese violins. This e vidence is attributed t o “new analysis, ”
which str ongly suggests that this pr ocess was unknown t o modern violin mak ers befor e that analysis. If the chemical tr eatment
was unknown until r ecently , the manufacturing pr ocess for modern violins must diff er with r espect t o the pr eviously unknown
practice of chemically tr eating the wood.

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Marilyn Dingle ’s bask ets. In this context,
to sa y that Dingle ’s bask ets ar e “handmade fr om” par ticular plants means that Dingle cr eates bask ets herself using those plants
but without using machines. The text sa ys that Dingle “ skillfully winds” par ts of palmett o palm plants ar ound sweetgr ass plants t o

from sweetgr ass and palmett o palm. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgr ass and palmett o palm t o create her bask ets, not how
her bask ets ar e “indicated b y,” or signiﬁed b y, sweetgr ass and palmett o palm. Choice C is incorr ect. Although Dingle ’s bask ets ar e

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the inv ention of the integr ated cir cuit. As
used in this context, "tr ansformed" means substantially changed in some wa y. The text states that the inv ention r adically alter ed
the semiconduct or industr y, with some hist orians claiming that it had a fundamental eff ect on the industr y by allowing for mass
production for the ﬁrst time. This context conv eys that the inv ention of the integr ated cir cuit tr ansformed the semiconduct or
industr y.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that the inv ention of the integr ated cir cuit signiﬁcantly aff ected ("r adically
alter ed") the semiconduct or industr y, it doesn ’t indicate that the inv ention " overwhelmed" the industr y, which in this context would
mean that it o vercame the industr y such that the industr y struggled or was def eated. Instead, the text conv eys that the inv ention ’s
effect was positiv e, since it allowed the semiconduct or industr y to begin making use of mass pr oduction methods. Choice B is
incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o sa y that the inv ention of the integr ated cir cuit "b ypassed" the
semiconduct or industr y, which would mean it intentionally a voided the industr y. The text indicates that the inv ention dir ectly

Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that the inv ention of the integr ated cir cuit " obstructed" the semiconduct or

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how maple tr ees ma y respond t o
changes in climate. As used in this context, " adapt t o" means t o adjust t o new conditions. The text ﬁrst notes that maple tr ees

Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text discusses how maple tr ees adjust t o change, the tr ees do not "r elocate fr om," or physically

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “ singular ” most nearly means extr aordinar y. The text por trays an
experiment in which a char acter r ehydrates a dried r ose b y infusing it with moistur e. After pr olonged contact with the liquid, the
rose begins t o absorb it, under going an ex ceptional tr ansformation: its color deepens, its pr eviously “ crushed and dried” petals

Choice A is incorr ect. Although in some contexts “ singular ” can mean of or r elating t o an individual or t o a single instance of

Choice B is the best answer . A person who is " dogmatic " belie ves str ongly that their principles and opinions ar e true. Because Du
Bois and Lock e are implied t o ha ve one "uniﬁed vision " of Black American identity that the y prioritiz e over the " diverse

Choice A is incorr ect. "Pr oﬁcient" means " skilled. " Du Bois and Lock e are contr asted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole.
The text begins with the underlined question, “How lif elike are the y?” The text then explains that many computer animat ors pose
this question about the envir onments and lighting that the y create for animated ﬁlms, striving for r ealistic animation of those
components e ven if the char acters themselv es ar en’t por trayed in r ealistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts t o describe how
some animat ors striv e to create envir onments and lighting that r eﬂect the ﬁlm ’s unique st ories r ather than making them appear
realistic. Ther efore, the function of the underlined question is t o reﬂect a primar y goal that many computer animat ors ha ve for
certain components of the animations the y produce.
Choice B is incorr ect because, as the text mak es clear , the underlined question is one posed b y computer animat ors who wish t o
create r ealistic back grounds and lighting eff ects, not b y those who, instead, wish t o create eff ects that r eﬂect ﬁlms’ unique st ories
and ar en’t necessarily r ealistic; this latter gr oup of animat ors is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorr ect. As the text
explains, many computer animat ors striv e for r ealistic envir onments and lighting, while others do not; this diff erence of appr oach
relates t o whether these components should be r ealistic, not t o how r ealism can be achie ved using curr ent technology , and the
text ne ver suggests that animat ors ar e uncer tain how t o achie ve it. Choice D is incorr ect because the underlined question per tains

that the driv ers who think a t oll is alr eady t oo high wouldn ’t be informed of a pr oposal for an e ven higher t oll; in fact, the text
implies that adv ocates of the pr oposal would " direct their ar guments" in fa vor of the incr ease t o those driv ers, e ven though the y

ID: c977cf cf Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how the ﬂow of information between two
regions of the br ain ma y aff ect the ease of people ’s decision making. In this context, "r educed" means decr eased. The text
presents the ﬁnding fr om a team of neur oeconomists that decision making ma y be connected t o communication between the
prefrontal cor tex and the parietal cor tex. In pr esenting this ﬁnding, the text suggests a contr ast between people who tend t o be
more decisiv e and people who mak e decisions mor e slowly . Accor ding t o the text, people tend t o be mor e decisiv e when the ﬂow
of information between the two br ain r egions is intensiﬁed, or str engthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people
mak e choices mor e slowly when the ﬂow of information between the two br ain r egions is decr eased.
Choice B is incorr ect because " evaluated" means assessed, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. Accor ding t o the text, people
tend t o be mor e decisiv e when the ﬂow of information between two br ain r egions is intensiﬁed, or str engthened. This suggests
that people ’s ease of decision making v aries based on the r ate of information tr aveling between the r egions, not based on an
effor t to assess the information. Choice C is incorr ect because " determined" means judged or inﬂuenced, neither of which would
mak e sense in context. Accor ding t o the text, people tend t o be mor e decisiv e when the ﬂow of information between two br ain
regions is intensiﬁed, or str engthened. This suggests that people ’s ease of decision making v aries based on the r ate of
information tr aveling between the r egions, not based on an effor t to judge or inﬂuence the information. Choice D is incorr ect
because " acquir ed" means de veloped or attained, neither of which would mak e sense in context. Accor ding t o the text, people
tend t o be mor e decisiv e when the ﬂow of information between two br ain r egions is intensiﬁed, or str engthened. This suggests

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. surmised
B. contriv ed
C. questioned
D. regretted
ID: e35d481c  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-
centur y household food pur chases. In this context, “ surmised” means formed an idea or assumption with little e vidence. The text
explains that cer tain economic hist orians “ assumed” that lar ge and small households spent diff erent amounts on food per person,
but that another economist found this supposition t o be false based on e vidence fr om a vailable data. This context suggests that
the economic hist orians made an incorr ect assumption without enough consider ation of e vidence.
Choice B is incorr ect. In this context, “ contriv ed” would mean br ought about or cr eated thr ough trick ery. Nothing in the text
suggests that the economic hist orians wer e deliber ately tr ying t o trick people with a claim about food pur chasing beha viors in late
nineteenth- and early twentieth-centur y households; the text simply suggests that the y made an assumption about those
beha viors that another hist orian belie ves isn ’t suppor ted b y the a vailable data. Choice C is incorr ect because the text indicates
that it’ s Logan and not the economic hist orians who “ questioned, ” or doubted, the assumption that lar ge and small households in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent diff erent amounts on food per person; the economic hist orians ar e the
ones who made that assumption t o begin with. Choice D is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic
historians “r egretted, ” or f elt sad or r emorseful about, the food pur chasing beha viors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-
centur y households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic hist orians made an assumption about those beha viors that
may not be suppor ted b y available data, not on the hist orians’ emotional r esponse t o what households did in the past.

A. Disor ganiz ed
B. Alarmed
C. Offended
D. Interrupted
ID: 45a109a3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “ disturbed” most nearly means alarmed. The text por trays the narr ator
traveling in a carriage as wolv es howl in the surr ounding darkness. The text contr asts the r eaction of both the narr ator and the
horses pulling the carriage with that of the driv er of the carriage: the narr ator and horses ar e “dreadfully afr aid,” but the driv er is
“not in the least disturbed. ” In other wor ds, the driv er is not alarmed b y the wolv es nearb y.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although in some contexts, “ disturbed” can mean disor ganiz ed, the text doesn ’t por tray a char acter acting in
a disor ganiz ed manner; instead, the driv er continues t o driv e the carriage, e ven though the horses pulling it ar e alarmed. Choice C
is incorr ect. Although in some contexts, “ disturbed” can mean off ended, the text doesn ’t por tray one char acter f eeling off ended, or
upset, b y another ’s actions; instead, it contr asts the f ear f elt b y the narr ator with another char acter ’s lack of f ear. Choice D is
incorr ect. Although in some contexts, “ disturbed” can mean interrupted, the text doesn ’t por tray an action being interrupted;

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . We’re told that charities that pa y donors back for nuisance costs will attr act a f ew lar ge donors
instead of many small donors. This suggests that nuisance costs ar e not link ed to donation siz e.
Choice A is incorr ect. This doesn ’t ﬁt the logic of the text. If nuisance costs ar e supplemental t o (meaning in addition t o) donation

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how Maggie Lena W alker addr essed the
lack of ﬁnancial ser vices a vailable t o Black r esidents in Richmond, Vir ginia, at the turn of the twentieth centur y. In this context,
"rectify " means t o corr ect or r emedy something undesir able. The text indicates that b y char tering the St. L uke Penny Sa vings Bank
in 1903, W alker took action t o provide local Black r esidents with gr eater access t o ﬁnancial ser vices lik e home loans and sa vings
oppor tunities. This context suppor ts the idea that she aimed t o rectify the undesir able situation aff ecting these r esidents.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " prolong" would mean t o lengthen something in time. The text indicates that at the
turn of the twentieth centur y, Black r esidents in Richmond, Vir ginia, wer e faced with a lack of formal banking options. The text then
states that W alker founded a new bank that pr ovided these r esidents with ﬁnancial ser vices. Ther efore, instead of pr olonging the

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined por tion in the text as a whole? 
A. It suggests that Shakti f eels uncomfor table near the riv er.
B. It indicates that Shakti has lost her sense of dir ection in the woods.
C. It emphasiz es Shakti’ s sense of belonging in the landscape.
D. It conv eys Shakti’ s appr eciation for her long-term friendships. 
ID: c966ad55  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole.
The ﬁrst sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined,
emphasiz es Shakti’ s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods b y describing how the tr ee br anches ar e friendly and
“welcoming, ” as the y are depicted as extending open arms t o her . The r emainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfor table
and content in the woods b y describing her as “ an old friend” of the tr ees. Thus, the function of the underlined por tion is t o
emphasiz e Shakti’ s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text and underlined por tion suggest that Shakti is comfor table, not uncomfor table, in her
surroundings: the tr ees ar ound her ar e described as welcoming and r eassuring. Mor eover, the underlined por tion discusses
Shakti’ s feelings in the for est, not the riv er, since she hasn ’t reached the riv er yet. Choice B is incorr ect because the text and
underlined por tion emphasiz e Shakti’ s familiarity with the woods. The tr ees ar e inviting, and she f eels lik e “an old friend” t o the
woods, so she isn ’t lost or confused ther e. Choice D is incorr ect because the thir d sentence uses the phr ase “ as an old friend”
ﬁgur atively in r eference t o Shakti’ s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in r eference t o her long-standing friendships with
other people, and the text and underlined por tion ne ver discuss her f eelings about such friendships.

A. waiv e
B. concede
C. refute
D. requir e
ID: 757077f9  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the signiﬁcance of the 2014
archaeological ﬁnding at El Algar . In this context, “ concede ” means t o admit something is true after ﬁrst r esisting that admission.
The text indicates that some r esear chers belie ve “Br onze Age societies wer e ruled b y men. ” But the Br onze Age burial of a woman
at El Algar included “v aluable objects signaling a high position of power ,” which would r aise the possibility that “ women ma y have
also held leadership r oles. ” Thus, the text is calling int o question the notion that only men wer e leaders in these societies and
speculating that people holding this view ma y reconsider their opinion.
Choice A is incorr ect because “ waiv e” means t o refrain fr om insisting that something, such as a right or a r equir ement, be
obser ved; the wor d isn ’t used, howe ver, in contexts wher e someone acknowledges that an opinion the y hold ma y be inv alid, as is
the case in the text. Choice C is incorr ect. Accor ding t o the text, the ﬁnding fr om the El Algar burial site undermines the view that
Bronze Age societies wer e exclusiv ely ruled b y men. Howe ver, “refute ” means t o demonstr ate that something is false and would
not mak e sense in context. L ull and team ’s ﬁnding suppor ts the view that women ma y have also held leadership r oles, not that
they did not par ticipate in such r oles. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context, “r equir e” means t o demand or specify as
mandat ory. Howe ver, it would not mak e sense for contempor ary resear chers t o demand that Br onze Age “ women ma y have also

C. State a pr eference about wher e to eat.
D. Change the subject t o talk about something else.
ID: eb89dcc8  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it dir ectly applies the r esear ch ﬁndings described in Text 2 t o the situation underlined in Text
1. The underlined sentence in Text 1 describes a common scenario in which two friends ar e deciding on a lunch location. Text 1
goes on t o explain that people often don ’t reveal their true pr eferences in such situations, instead claiming the y’re ﬁne with any
option so that the y can appear mor e easy going and likable. Text 2 pr esents r esear ch that advises against this appr oach, stating
that people who don ’t expr ess their pr eferences ar en’t viewed as mor e likable and that this beha vior actually mak es decisions
more diﬃcult for others. Since Text 2 speciﬁcally ar gues against the str ategy of concealing pr eferences and indicates negativ e
outcomes fr om doing so, the author of Text 2 would most lik ely recommend stating a pr eference about wher e to eat.
Choice A is incorr ect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that canceling plans is a good solution. The author of Text 2 is
addr essing how t o mak e joint decisions eff ectiv ely (thr ough stating y our own pr eference), not adv ocating for a voiding such
decisions entir ely. Choice B is incorr ect because asking wher e the friend typically lik es to eat still a voids stating one ’s own
preference. While this appr oach might seem consider ate, it continues the pattern of not r evealing true pr eferences that Text 2
identiﬁes as pr oblematic. Choice D is incorr ect because changing the subject would a void making any decision alt ogether , which
contr adicts the implied advice in Text 2. The author of Text 2 pr esents r esear ch suggesting that dir ectly engaging with the decision
by stating pr eferences helps others mak e decisions and mak es you appear mor e likable.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text, which is t o explain a study ’s
conclusion and how r esear chers inv olved in the study arriv ed at that conclusion. The text begins b y summarizing the main
conclusion of the study conducted b y Paul Hanel and colleagues: when confr onted with ideas the y disagr ee with in discussions
about contr oversial t opics, people ar e mor e likely to respond politely if the y think about their personal v alues befor e engaging in
such discussions. The text then goes on t o describe the design of Hanel and colleagues’ experiment. By comparing inter actions
between members of an experimental gr oup (who had been pr ompted t o write about their personal v alues befor ehand) t o those
between members of a contr ol gr oup (who had been pr ompted t o write about a be verage), the team found that people in the
experimental gr oup beha ved mor e civilly , or politely , than people in the contr ol gr oup did during discussions about a contr oversial
topic. This ﬁnding led t o the conclusion described at the beginning of the text.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text discusses the r esults of a study , it doesn ’t provide any indication that the conclusion the
study suppor ted—that when facing disagr eement, people beha ve mor e politely when the y have thought about their v alues—is a
belief that is widely held. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that the r esear chers found the r esults of their
study t o be surprising, or contr ary to what the y expected. In fact, ther e’s no indication pr ovided in the text about how the
resear chers f elt about the study ’s results or that the r esults should be consider ed surprising. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the
text discusses the experimental design of a study , it doesn ’t suggest any impr ovements t o that design; instead, it focuses on how
the design enabled the r esear chers t o draw a par ticular conclusion.

it doesn ’t discuss any pr ofessional connections she made in these r oles or indicate that she used any such connections in her

B. The women char acters in John Fletcher ’s pla ys ar e similar t o the women char acters in Philip Massinger ’s pla ys.
C. The Two Noble Kinsmen  belongs in one-v olume compilations of Shak espear e’s complete pla ys.
D. Philip Massinger ’s style in the ﬁrst and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen  is an homage t o Shak espear e’s style.
ID: 97e5bf55  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . Text 1 states that Syk es felt Fletcher ’s contributions t o the pla y wer e ob vious because he had a
distinct style in his other pla ys. Text 2 states that scholars gener ally agr ee “on the basis of style ” that Fletcher wr ote most of the
three middle acts. Both texts imply that Fletcher ’s writing has a unique, r eadily identiﬁable style that can be used t o distinguish his
work fr om others.
Choice B is incorr ect. While Text 1 r efers t o the women in Massinger pla ys, neither text compar es the women of Fletcher ’s pla ys to
the women of Massinger ’s pla ys. Text 2 doesn ’t mention Massinger at all. Choice C is incorr ect. Text 1 states that Syk es disputed
that Shak espear e coauthor ed the pla y, and implied that it was coauthor ed b y Fletcher and Massinger instead. Syk es, ther efore,
would disagr ee that The Two Noble Kinsmen  belongs in a Shak espear e compilation. Choice D is incorr ect. Text 1 doesn ’t suggest
that Massinger was inspir ed b y Shak espear e, and Text 2 doesn ’t mention Massinger at all.

A. Acquir ed
B. Acknowledged
C. Imitated
D. Speculated
ID: 84ece3f6  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “ assumed” most nearly means acquir ed, or came t o possess. The text
portrays a char acter named Dr owne car ving a ﬁgur e out of wood. A t ﬁrst “irr egular and misty ,” or haphazar d and indistinct, the
ﬁgur e’s outline gr adually showed “ distincter gr ace and beauty ” until the gener al design of the car ved object “ was now ob vious t o
the common e ye,” or plainly r ecognizable t o any one. In other wor ds, as Dr owne continued t o car ve, the wooden object came t o
possess, or acquir ed, gr eater pr ecision, changing fr om an indistinct outline or shape int o a gr aceful, beautiful, and clearly
recognizable form.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although in some contexts “ assumed” can mean acknowledged, or r ecogniz ed, it doesn ’t ha ve that meaning
in this context because an inanimate object lik e the wooden ﬁgur e can ’t acknowledge its own pr ecision. Choice C is incorr ect
because ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that the wooden ﬁgur e mer ely imitated, or mimick ed, pr ecision. Rather , the text
suggests that as Dr owne car ved his wooden ﬁgur e, it gr adually became mor e precise. Choice D is incorr ect. Although in some
contexts “ assumed” can mean speculated, or supposed based on incomplete information, it doesn ’t ha ve that meaning in this
context because an inanimate object lik e the wooden ﬁgur e can ’t speculate about its own pr ecision.

ID: 95f037ad  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Ester Hernandez’ s art. In this context,
"featur ed" means shown pr ominently . The text focuses on wher e Hernandez’ s works ha ve been and continue t o be displa yed,
explaining that her early works, which consisted of mur als, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San F rancisco. The centr al
contr ast de veloped in the text is between wher e her early works could be viewed and wher e her works can be viewed now , which is
in museums acr oss the United States and ar ound the world. The context ther efore suppor ts the idea that Hernandez’ s works ar e
now shown, or f eatur ed, in museums globally .
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context "inv ented" would mean cr eated something for the ﬁrst time, which isn ’t suppor ted
since the text doesn ’t discuss wher e Hernandez cr eates her works or whether the y’re original or inno vative. Choice B is incorr ect
because " adjusted" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez’ s early works wer e
outdoor mur als and thus it ma y be r easonable t o inf er that Hernandez alter ed her appr oach t o creating ar t so that her works could
be displa yed in indoor v enues instead, the text mak es no mention of how Hernandez’ s works might ha ve been adapted for such
venues. The text focuses on wher e Hernandez’ s works ha ve been and continue t o be displa yed, not on how she or any one else
may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorr ect because "r ecommended" in this context would mean endorsed or
put for th as a suggestion for something that is wor th seeing. Although it ma y be r easonable t o sa y that in choosing t o displa y
certain works, museum cur ators belie ve such works ar e wor th seeing, the text doesn ’t discuss the r easons why museums displa y

ID: e386a11d  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Hishida Shunsō ’s painting Cat and Plum
Blossoms . In this context, " embr aced" means accepted or adopted r eadily . The text begins b y identifying Cat and Plum Blossoms
as an example of Nihonga , or classical (that is, tr aditional) Japanese painting. The text continues b y drawing a contr ast between
Hishida ’s work and K uroda Seiki’ s work, which diff ers fr om that of Hishida in its use of the tr aditional E uropean method of using oil
paints on canv as rather than using tr aditional Japanese appr oaches. The text then concludes with an example of one such
traditional Japanese painting technique ex empliﬁed b y Hishida ’s Cat and Plum Blossoms —applications of color pigments t o a silk
scroll—t o fur ther de velop the contr ast between the two ar tists’ appr oaches. This context suppor ts the idea that Hishida adopted,
or embr aced, tr aditional Japanese appr oaches.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context " distrusted" would mean that Hishida was sk eptical of or lack ed conﬁdence in
traditional Japanese appr oaches t o painting. The text begins b y stating that Hishida ’s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms  is an
example of Nihonga , or tr aditional Japanese painting, and then cites Hishida ’s application of color pigments t o a silk scr oll as an
instance of a tr aditional Japanese painting technique. It ther efore wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that Hishida ’s use of tr aditional
Japanese painting techniques indicates his distrust, or sk epticism, of them. Rather , it suggests that he embr aced those
techniques. Choice C is incorr ect because sa ying that Hishida "r eleased" tr aditional Japanese appr oaches t o painting in this
context would mean that he fr eed them fr om any r estrictions. In using Hishida ’s application of color pigments t o a silk scr oll in Cat
and Plum Blossoms  as an example of a tr aditional Japanese appr oach t o painting found in Nihonga , the text str ongly implies that
Hishida followed these appr oaches, not that he r emo ved them fr om any r estrictions. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context
"overlook ed" would mean ignor ed or failed t o notice. The text establishes that Hishida ’s painting Cat and Plum Blossoms  is a
notable work of Nihonga , or classical Japanese painting, that f eatur es the tr aditional technique of applying color pigments t o a silk
scroll. It wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that Hishida ’s use of a tr aditional Japanese appr oach t o painting indicates that Hishida failed

ID: e818241b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst
sentence establishes something astr onomers belie ve with some cer tainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a superno va. The
second sentence then intr oduces a pr oblem: astr onomers ar en’t cer tain when Betelgeuse will explode because the y don ’t ha ve
enough information about the star ’s internal char acteristics. Finally , the thir d sentence indicates that r esear cher Sar aﬁna El-Badr y
Nance and colleagues inv estigated a possible method of obtaining the necessar y information about Betelgeuse ’s internal
char acteristics, though the y found that the method wouldn ’t be suﬃcient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is t o identify
the pr oblem that Nance and colleagues attempted t o solv e but didn ’t.
Choice A is incorr ect because the second sentence intr oduces the gener al pr oblem Nance and colleagues hoped t o solv e, not a
serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried t o solv e it. It is the thir d sentence that intr oduces Nance and colleagues, but
no serious limitation of their appr oach t o studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is
incorr ect because the second sentence intr oduces the gener al pr oblem Nance and colleagues hoped t o solv e, not the centr al
ﬁnding the y ultimately r epor ted. It is the thir d sentence that pr esents Nance and colleagues’ conclusion that a potential method
for determining internal stellar states would be insuﬃcient. Choice D is incorr ect because the second sentence doesn ’t indicate
how other astr onomers or astr ophysicists r esponded t o the work done b y Nance and colleagues; the text doesn ’t addr ess this

The text then indicates that the population siz e did indeed gr ow as a r esult of the planted tr ees. Thus, in this context, the

one possible explanation for the r elationship being discussed is that pr actitioners ma y overlook confounding v ariables—that is,
additional fact ors other than the medical inter ventions being inv estigated that aff ect the obser ved outcomes. This means that
practitioners ma y assume that an outcome is the dir ect r esult of a medical inter vention when it is actually the r esult of a

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of business mark eting pr actices. In this
context, " optimiz e" means mak e the most eff ectiv e possible use of a vailable oppor tunities. The text indicates that though
businesses typically tr y to promote themselv es, the y don ’t alwa ys mak e use of eff ectiv e tools for doing so, pointing t o resear ch
showing that 33 per cent of r estaur ants failed t o use a fr ee listing ser vice that incr eased r evenue b y 5 per cent on a verage for
restaur ants that did use the ser vice. The text ther efore suggests that b y for egoing a fr ee and eff ectiv e mark eting t ool, some
businesses ar en’t making the best use of, or optimizing, mark eting oppor tunities.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " adorn " would mean decor ate or enhance the appear ance of, and ther e’s nothing in
the text t o suggest that b y failing t o use a fr ee and eff ectiv e promotional t ool, some businesses ar en’t enhancing the appear ance
of their own mark eting. The example in the text illustr ates that some businesses ar en’t utilizing an eff ectiv e mark eting oppor tunity ,
not that the y aren’t impr oving the appear ance of their mark eting. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context, " endorse " would
mean openly appr ove or r ecommend, and the text’ s discussion of the fact that some businesses ha ve overlook ed an eff ectiv e
mark eting t ool doesn ’t suppor t the idea that those businesses ther efore don ’t appr ove of their own mark eting. Choice D is
incorr ect because in this context, sa ying that businesses don ’t "counter act" their mark eting would suggest that the y don ’t activ ely
undermine it or mak e it ineff ectiv e. The text begins b y stating that businesses typically tr y to promote themselv es but then
continues t o imply that some businesses fail t o tak e adv antage of good oppor tunities t o do so, citing the example of businesses
that failed t o use a fr ee and eff ectiv e mark eting t ool. Though it’ s possible that those businesses that did use the site ther efore
didn ’t unintentionally counter act their own mark eting, the ﬁrst sentence conv eys that the text’ s focus is on things that some

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. demands
B. speculates
C. doubts
D. establishes
ID: 97ab5669  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Ochoa ’s prediction that humans will one
day need t o live in places other than Ear th. As used in this context, “ speculates” would mean puts for ward an idea without ﬁrm
evidence. The text states that Ochoa “ doesn ’t ha ve a deﬁnite idea ” about when humans might need t o live in other envir onments
and char acteriz es Ochoa ’s prediction as a “ conjectur e,” or a conclusion pr esented without convincing e vidence. This context
indicates that Ochoa speculates when she mak es this pr ediction. 
Choice A is incorr ect because sa ying that Ochoa “ demands, ” or insists or r equir es, that humans will one da y need t o live in other
envir onments than Ear th’s would not mak e sense in context. The text indicates that she ’s unsur e about the timing but
hypothesiz es that it will someda y happen. Choice C is incorr ect because  sa ying that Ochoa “ doubts, ” or questions or disbelie ves,
that humans will one da y need t o live in other envir onments than Ear th’s would not mak e sense in context. The text indicates that
although Ochoa is unsur e about the timing, she hypothesiz es that humans will need t o live in places other than Ear th and
encour ages r esear ch int o futur e travel to the moon. Choice D is incorr ect because  sa ying that Ochoa “ establishes, ” or pr oves, that
humans will one da y need t o live in other envir onments than Ear th’s would not mak e sense in context. Rather than stating that
Ochoa discusses her idea with cer tainty and suppor ts it with e vidence, the text indicates that Ochoa is unsur e about when humans

A. cause
B. existence
C. implication
D. scale
ID: be612a26  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the W boson. In this context, " scale "
means siz e or extent. The text indicates that r ecent measur ements of the W boson wer e remarkable because the y revealed the
subat omic par ticle’s mass t o be much gr eater (" seven standar d de viations higher ") than had been expected based on a standar d
model. This context conv eys not only that the measur ements diff ered fr om pr edictions but also that the extent of the diff erence
was v ery large.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that ther e was a v ery large diff erence between the pr edicted mass and the actual
measur ed mass of the subat omic par ticle, it doesn ’t explain the cause of, or r eason behind, that diff erence. Choice B is incorr ect
because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that the measur ements of the subat omic par ticle wer e notable because the y diff ered fr om
expectations and also because a diff erence existed between the measur ements and what had been pr edicted; the text would be
repeating the idea that ther e was a diff erence instead of adding t o that idea. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t conv ey
any implications of, or consequences of or conclusions dr awn fr om, the fact that the mass of the subat omic par ticle diff ered fr om
expectations; the context indicates only that the actual measur ed mass was much higher than the pr edicted mass.

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, " completing" most nearly means ﬁnishing. In the text, the narr ator

she has " sent off the manuscript. " In other wor ds, the narr ator is looking for ward to ﬁnishing her work on the manuscript and

Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " completing" doesn ’t mean destr oying, or ruining. The narr ator addr esses her desir e
to send off the manuscript she ’s focused on and her hope that things will be " normal again " once she does, conv eying that she is
looking for ward to ﬁnishing the work, not t o ruining it. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context, " completing" doesn ’t mean
advertising, or publicly pr omoting. The narr ator addr esses her complete focus on the tr anslation and her hope that things will be
"normal again " once she has " sent off the manuscript, " conv eying that she is looking for ward to ﬁnishing the task, not t o promoting
the r esulting manuscript. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context, " completing" doesn ’t mean r ejecting, or r efusing or
repelling. The narr ator mak es it clear that she is absorbed in working on the tr anslation and plans t o send off the manuscript,
suggesting that instead of r efusing t o do the work, she is continuing t o do it (e ven if she looks for ward to things being " normal

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. desult ory
B. spurious
C. veritable
D. notional
ID: 6c9f1727  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Theia and the origin of the Moon. In this
context, " notional" means theor etical or only an idea. The text indicates that although something was once true of Theia, the
protoplanet one theor y holds collided with Ear th and cr eated debris that became the Moon, r esear chers now claim t o ha ve
identiﬁed pieces of it deep in Ear th’s mantle. In other wor ds, ha ving dir ect e vidence of Theia is a new de velopment. This context
suggests that befor e evidence was found, Theia was only theor etical—that is, that it was notional.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that Theia, a pr otoplanet, was " desult ory," which in this context would mean
moving awa y from the matter at hand; indeed, the text focuses on the "big whack" theor y of the origin of the Moon and indicates
that Theia is a centr al par t of that theor y. Choice B is incorr ect because the text mak es the point that something was true of Theia
until r ecently and suggests that this has changed now that r esear chers belie ve the y have found pieces of the pr otoplanet deep in
Earth’s mantle. It wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that Theia was actually " spurious, " or false, until r esear chers found dir ect e vidence of
the pr otoplanet. (Although Theia ’s existence might not ha ve been cer tain, it would not ha ve been false simply because ther e was
no e vidence of it.) Choice C is incorr ect because the text mak es the point that something was true of Theia until r ecently and
suggests that this has changed now that r esear chers belie ve the y have found pieces of the pr otoplanet deep in Ear th’s mantle. It
wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that Theia was "v eritable, " or r eal, befor e resear chers found dir ect e vidence of its existence: the

ID: 06b96bf c Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Renata Flor es Riv era’s use of Quechua in
her music. In this context, “inexperienced with ” means not accust omed t o. The text indicates that Flor es Riv era wanted t o promote
the Quechua language in her music and o vercame a challenge b y seeking help with pr onunciation fr om her gr andmother and b y
taking language classes. This context conv eys the idea that Flor es Riv era was not suﬃciently familiar with Quechua t o use it in her
music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addr essed b y seeking help.
Choice A is incorr ect because describing Flor es Riv era as “ prepar ed for ”—or r eady for—speaking Quechua wouldn ’t mak e sense in
context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua pr esented a challenge, but if she wer e ready t o speak the language, then ther e
would be no challenge. Choice C is incorr ect because describing Flor es Riv era as “ skilled in ”—meaning good at or capable of—
speaking Quechua wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua pr esented a challenge, but if she
were capable of speaking the language, then ther e would be no challenge. Choice D is incorr ect. Flor es Riv era was lik ely “excited
about”—or thrilled or delighted with—speaking Quechua, but this wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text indicates that speaking

A. indistinct
B. irrelevant
C. indisputable
D. implicit
ID: 3f37eb3b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion about people ’s tendency t o dismiss claims
from sour ces per ceived as self-inter ested, or acting for their own adv antage. In this context, "irr elevant" means not applicable t o
the matter at hand. The text explains that as a matter of logical r easoning, the sour ce of a claim has nothing t o do with the claim ’s
truthfulness—a claim is either true or false in actuality , regar dless of wher e it originates. This context suggests that e ven though
people ma y distrust a claim based on its sour ce, the sour ce of the claim is actually irr elevant.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, "indistinct" would mean uncer tain or not clearly r ecognizable. Instead of suggesting
that the sour ce of a claim can ’t be determined with cer tainty , the text suggests that r ecognizing a sour ce and ha ving an opinion of
it simply doesn ’t matter because as a matter of logic, a claim is true or false in actuality , regar dless of wher e it originates. Choice
C is incorr ect because in this context, "indisputable " would mean impossible t o question or deny . Although the text suggests that it
isn’t logical t o assume a claim is false just because its sour ce appears t o be self-inter ested, it doesn ’t go so far as t o suggest that
the sour ce of a claim can ’t be questioned—the text instead mak es the point that fr om a logical standpoint, the sour ce of a claim
doesn ’t matter because the claim is either true or false in and of itself. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context, "implicit"
would mean suggested or underst ood without being dir ectly expr essed. Nothing in the text suggests that logically , the sour ce of a
claim is only suggested; instead of addr essing whether sour ces can be dir ectly identiﬁed, the text focuses on the idea that sour ces
don’t matter because a claim is true or false in actuality , regar dless of wher e it originates.

A. repudiates
B. proclaims
C. foretells
D. recants
ID: 93665100  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Sterlin Harjo ’s appr oach t o representing
Nativ e char acters on tele vision. As used in this context, “r epudiates” means r ejects or r efuses t o ha ve anything t o do with. The text
indicates that tele vision shows tend t o depict Nativ e char acters as living long ago, but that Harjo ’s series Reser vation Dogs
focuses on Nativ e teenagers in the pr esent da y, representing a “r ejection ” of the typical appr oach t o depicting Nativ e char acters.
This context thus indicates that Harjo r epudiates tele vision ’s gener al tendency r egar ding Nativ e char acters. 
Choice B is incorr ect because the text describes Harjo ’s “rejection ” of the typical appr oach t o representing Nativ e char acters on
television, so it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that Harjo “ proclaims, ” or declar es or aﬃrms, tele vision ’s gener al tendency r egar ding
Nativ e char acters. Harjo is described as r efusing t o follow the pattern of depicting Nativ e char acters in the distant past, not as
proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorr ect because the text describes tele vision ’s tendency t o represent Nativ e char acters in
the distant past as something that is alr eady occurring, not as something that Harjo “for etells, ” or pr edicts will happen in the
futur e. The text is focused on Harjo ’s “rejection ” of this pattern, not on any pr edictions he ma y have about it. Choice D is incorr ect
because sa ying that Harjo “r ecants” something would mean that he withdr aws a pr eviously held belief, and it wouldn ’t mak e sense
to sa y that Harjo r ecants tele vision ’s tendency t o represent Nativ e char acters as living in the past. No beliefs pr eviously held b y
Harjo ar e mentioned. Additionally , a tendency isn ’t a belief and thus isn ’t something that can be r ecanted.

A. Hidden
B. Discussed
C. Extended
D. Coated
ID: 0f040c50  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “ spread” most nearly means extended. The text states that the z oo is
“huge, ” that it co vers “ numberless acr es,” and that it is lar ge enough that a tr ain is needed t o explor e it. Thus, the text’ s emphasis
on the z oo’s siz e suggests that the z oo extended, or str etched, o ver a lar ge ar ea of land.
Choice A is incorr ect because if the z oo co vers “ numberless acr es,” then it could not r easonably be described as hidden, or
concealed fr om view . Choice B is incorr ect because ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that the z oo was discussed, or talk ed
about. Rather , the text focuses on the z oo’s lar ge siz e. Choice D is incorr ect. Although in some contexts “ spread” can mean coated,
it doesn ’t ha ve that meaning in this context because t o coat something means t o apply a thin la yer of a liquid substance, such as

A. struggling
B. beneﬁcial
C. simple
D. healthy
ID: e1d5d5df  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of damage t o viburnum plants. In this
context, “healthy ” would mean not distr essed or diseased. The text states that insect damage ma y cause viburnum plants t o be
discolor ed and ha ve abnormal gr owths. In the next sentence, the phr ase “ on the other hand” indicates a contr ast with the
description of plants suff ering fr om damage. Thus, the context contr asts the appear ance of healthy , undamaged plants with the
appear ance of damaged plants.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, “ struggling” would mean working against diﬃculties. The text ﬁrst describes
viburnum plants experiencing damage b y insects, and the phr ase “ on the other hand” then establishes a contr ast with that
description. It wouldn ’t mak e sense t o contr ast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged b y insects, because in both
cases the plants would be experiencing diﬃculties. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, “beneﬁcial” would mean
producing good or helpful eff ects. The text doesn ’t discuss how viburnum plants aff ect other things or suggest that the plants ar e
helpful in some wa y; rather , it focuses on how viburnum plants ar e aff ected b y cer tain conditions. Choice C is incorr ect because in
this context “ simple ” would mean plain or uncomplicated. The text doesn ’t discuss whether cer tain viburnum plants ar e

D. It describes how r esear chers determined wher e the Ba yeux Tapestr y was pr oduced.
ID: cef79fb9  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole.
The text discusses the Ba yeux Tapestr y, making the point that the work ers who pr oduced the huge tapestr y in the ele venth centur y
might not ha ve ever pr oduced a tapestr y so lar ge befor e. The text goes on t o suggest that because of this lack of pr evious
experience, the work ers de veloped and r eﬁned the pr ocess of joining the tapestr y’s panels o ver time as the y work ed. The last
sentence of the text then pr ovides an example of an obser vation that suggests the work ers’ pr ocess changed: clear misalignment
of the bor ders of the two panels the work ers joined ﬁrst and vir tually invisible joins completed later . Thus, the underlined sentence
serves to suppor t an ar gument about the work ers who pr oduced the tapestr y.
Choice A is incorr ect because the example giv en in the last sentence of the text has t o do with how the panels of the Ba yeux
Tapestr y wer e joined b y the work ers, not with what is depicted in those panels; the text ne ver identiﬁes any people or places
depicted in the tapestr y. Choice C is incorr ect because the last sentence compar es how early panels in the Ba yeux Tapestr y wer e
joined with how later panels in the same tapestr y wer e joined; it doesn ’t mak e any comparison between the Ba yeux Tapestr y and
other tapestries fr om the same time in F rance. Choice D is incorr ect because the last sentence doesn ’t addr ess the location wher e
the Ba yeux Tapestr y was cr eated; the ﬁrst sentence of the text pr esents it as a giv en that the tapestr y was cr eated in F rance, but
nothing in the text indicates how that origin was determined.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the Moon ’s sur face. In this context,
“reﬂect” means show or mak e appar ent. The text states that because the sur face of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still
forming than it is now , early aster oid and meteor oid impacts “ would ha ve left less of an impr ession ” and, as a r esult, e vidence of
them ma y no longer exist. This context suppor ts the idea that the sur face of the Moon ma y not accur ately show signs of early

Choice B is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that the sur face of the Moon ma y not accur ately “r eceiv e,” or acquir e

A. Restricted
B. Described
C. Developed
D. Settled
ID: e459076b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “ contr acted” most nearly means de veloped. The text explains that Mr .
Brooke has a “t oo rambling habit of mind, ” which the text lik ens t o a disease, sa ying he is thought t o ha ve contr acted it. To
contr act a disease means t o acquir e or de velop a disease. In other wor ds, the text indicates that Mr . Brooke is belie ved to ha ve
acquir ed, or de veloped, the habit of mind described in the text.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although “ contr acted” can mean limited or r estricted in some contexts, her e Mr . Brooke is said t o draw
unpr edictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “t oo rambling habit of mind, ” not that it has been somehow limited or
restricted. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text describes Mr . Brooke’s habit of mind, nothing suggests that those ar e his
descriptions or , indeed, that he described his habit of mind at all. Choice D is incorr ect because settled means calmed or

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of hist orical e vidence about ancient E gypt
under the r eign of the phar aoh Hatshepsut. In this context, " an exhaustiv e" account would be a thor ough one. The text states that
much of the e vidence fr om her r eign was purposely destr oyed—in other wor ds, ther e is a lack of sur viving r ecor ds. This context
conv eys that unless ther e are major new ar chaeological disco veries, an exhaustiv e account of Hatshepsut’ s reign is unlik ely.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " an imaginativ e" account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas and
speculation, r ather than facts. The text indicates that much of the e vidence of Hatshepsut’ s reign was deliber ately destr oyed, and
a lack of e vidence actually mak es it mor e likely that accounts will be imaginativ e to some degr ee and not strictly factual. Choice B
is incorr ect because in this context, " a superﬁcial" account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is
obvious. The text indicates that most e vidence of Hatshepsut’ s reign was purposely destr oyed, which suggests that accounts of
that time ar e likely alr eady somewhat superﬁcial, since ther e is little information a vailable t o suppor t deeper knowledge. F urther, it
would be illogical t o suggest that disco vering major new e vidence would mak e it mor e likely that accounts would be superﬁcial.
Choice D is incorr ect because " a questionable " account would be one lik ely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text
suggests that little e vidence of Hatshepsut’ s reign has sur vived, accounts of that time pr obably inv olve some speculation and thus
may already be open t o doubt. F urther, it would be illogical t o suggest that disco vering major new e vidence would mak e it mor e

Choice A is the best answer because it describes how the underlined por tion of the sentence functions in the text as a whole. The
text begins b y discussing or dinar y soap bubbles, objects that usually exist for less than a minute befor e popping due t o either
evapor ation or gr avity-induced dr ainage. The text then goes on t o mention work b y resear chers A ymeric Roux and colleagues, who
have disco vered how t o incr ease the longe vity of bubbles b y altering their chemical composition. Finally , the underlined por tion of
the text describes how this pr ocess works: since the bubble contains both water and gly cerol, it can dr aw water molecules fr om
the surr ounding air t o replace those lost t o evapor ation. Ther efore, the underlined por tion of the sentence describes the eff ects of
a process de vised b y resear chers that incr eases the longe vity of an object described in the text.
Choice B is incorr ect because the cir cumstance that pr ompted the r esear ch is discussed in the ﬁrst sentence of the text, not the

ID: 4974b053  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Octa via Butler ’s car eer. In this context,
“impenetr able ” means impossible t o enter . The text indicates that the ﬁeld of science ﬁction was dominated b y white males when
Butler , a Black woman, star ted writing, but she published se veral science ﬁction shor t stories and a no vel and later won a
prestigious awar d; that is, Butler pursued science ﬁction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn ’t view the
genr e as impossible t o enter .
Choice A is incorr ect. In this context, “legitimate ” would mean genuinely good or v alid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler
didn ’t think the science ﬁction genr e was good or v alid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful car eer of
publishing work in that ﬁeld. Choice C is incorr ect. In this context, “ compelling” would mean attr acting or demanding attention. The
text indicates that Butler chose t o write science ﬁction, so it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that she didn ’t see the ﬁeld as dr awing
her attention. Choice D is incorr ect. To sa y that Butler didn ’t consider science ﬁction “indecipher able, ” or impossible t o understand,

ID: 3ec184af  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of noses on ancient sculptur es. In this
context, "fr agile " means weak or delicate. This matches the text’ s description of noses on ancient sculptur es, which ar e often
missing fr om sculptur es’ heads because the y are "especially easy t o break." Ther efore, this context indicates that noses on ancient
sculptur es ar e the most fr agile par t of the sculptur es’ heads.
Choice A is incorr ect. In this context, "r ecognizable " would mean identiﬁable, and since the text indicates that noses ar e often
missing fr om ancient statues, the y ther efore cannot be the most r ecognizable par t of the statue. Choice C is incorr ect because the
text indicates that many ancient statues ar e missing noses, so noses wouldn ’t be " common, " or fr equent, aspects of ancient

Growth in the use of no vel nanohybrids—materials cr eated fr om the conjugation of multiple distinct nanomaterials, such as ir on
oxide and gold nanomaterials conjugated for use in magnetic imaging—has outpaced studies of nanohybrids’ envir onmental risks.
Unfor tunately , risk e valuations based on nanohybrids’ constituents ar e not r eliable: conjugation ma y alter constituents’
physiochemical pr oper ties such that innocuous nanomaterials form a nanohybrid that is anything but .
Text 2
The potential for enhanced t oxicity of nanohybrids r elativ e to the t oxicity of constituent nanomaterials has dr awn deser ved
attention, but the eff ects of nanomaterial conjugation v ary by case. F or instance, it was r ecently shown that a nanohybrid of silicon

ID: 105ea6de  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The author of Text 2 acknowledges that nanohybrids ma y be mor e toxic than their constituent par ts,
but also pr ovides an example of a nanohybrid that has r educed t oxicity compar ed to its components: silicon dio xide and zinc
oxide t ogether ha ve all the beneﬁts of zinc o xide nanopar ticles without any of the DN A harm zinc o xide has on its own.
Choice A is incorr ect. While the author of Text 2 giv es an example of a nanohybrid that isn ’t as t oxic as its constituent par ts, the y
don’t argue that the beneﬁt outweighs the risk. They mer ely ar gue that “the eff ects of nanomaterial conjugation v ary by case. ”
Choice B is incorr ect. The author of Text 2 states that the eff ects of nanomaterial conjugation “v ary by case, ” and that the attention
that their potential t oxicity has dr awn is warr anted. If the situation in Text 1 wer en’t representativ e, then ther e would be less
attention t o the potential danger of these materials. F urthermor e, neither passage suggests that r esear chers had expected that

Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main purpose of the text, which is t o conv ey the speak er’s
longing for the ocean t o impar t a sense of inner tr anquility , or peace. The text begins b y expr essing the speak er’s str ong desir e to
be on the ocean, appealing dir ectly t o the wa ves to rock the speak er to sleep. The poem then describes the " slumber ous lullab y"
formed b y the sound of the wa ves and the winds on which the speak er wishes t o be carried " gently ...between a peaceful sea and

Choice A is incorr ect. Giv en the poem ’s expr ession of a longing t o achie ve tranquility b y drifting on the ocean, it can be inf erred
that the speak er desir es to escape something unpleasant in daily lif e. Howe ver, the poem doesn ’t refer dir ectly t o any such
hardship—ongoing or other wise. And since the poem doesn ’t establish that the speak er is experiencing a desir e to escape ongoing
hardship, it can ’t be said that such a desir e incr eases in intensity . Choice B is incorr ect. The speak er does expr ess a desir e for the
serenity of being r ocked to sleep b y the ocean, and it can be inf erred that this desir e is a r esponse t o demands that mak e the
speak er’s daily lif e str essful. Howe ver, the poem doesn ’t refer dir ectly t o such demands or contr ast them with the tr anquility of
drifting on the ocean. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest the speak er has any qualms, or r eser vations, about
being tr anspor ted b y the ocean. On the contr ary, the speak er activ ely desir es to "drift far out" and be carried b y the wa ves and

D. To describe Jane ’s determination t o secur e emplo yment outside of Thornﬁeld Hall
ID: 03c9f327  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text, which is t o show that while Jane
calmly goes about her daily tasks, she is experiencing internal agitation about possibly seeking a new job. A t the star t of the text,
Jane sa ys, “I went on with my da y’s business tr anquilly ,” indicating that she is outwar dly calm. This outwar d calmness is then
contr asted with her intense internal r estlessness, as Jane sa ys that thoughts of lea ving her job k eep running thr ough her mind,
that she is “inv oluntarily fr aming adv ertisements” (meaning that she can ’t stop herself fr om thinking up potential listings for jobs),
and that she often wonders what new “ situations” (or jobs) would be lik e. 
Choice B is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication of Jane ’s feelings, either positiv e or negativ e, about the people she
works for at Thornﬁeld Hall. And r ather than emphasizing that Jane f eels par ticularly lo yal to her emplo yers, the text focuses on
her constant consider ation of lea ving her job. Choice C is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that Jane ﬁnds her curr ent
situation fulﬁlling, or satisfying. Giv en that much of the text is focused on Jane ’s thoughts about possibly lea ving her job for a new
one, it might be the case that she ﬁnds her situation challenging, but ther e is no e vidence in the text that Jane also ﬁnds that
situation satisfying—she sa ys nothing positiv e about her curr ent job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorr ect because the text describes
Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined t o deﬁnitely do so. Jane k eeps thinking about r easons why she
“should” quit her curr ent job (indicating that she hasn ’t yet decided t o) and imagining possible new situations she could ﬁnd, but
she sa ys at the end of the text that these thoughts “ might germinate and bear fruit if the y could, ” meaning that the thoughts
haven’t yet led t o a decision—that Jane isn ’t yet determined t o get a new job somewher e else.

ID: e3f05561  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Ulysses Jenkins’ s video ar t. As used in
this context, “ newfound” means r ecently disco vered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video camer as became
cheaper and ther efore mor e widely a vailable than the y had been in the past. The text goes on t o sa y that this de velopment
provided Jenkins and other ar tists with capabilities that the y previously didn ’t ha ve. As a r esult, Jenkins began pr oducing
groundbr eaking works of video ar t. This context suppor ts the idea that Jenkins t ook adv antage of newfound access t o video
camer as.
Choice B is incorr ect because “ delicate ” means ﬁne in textur e or structur e or easily br oken, neither of which would mak e sense in
this context. The text doesn ’t focus on describing what video ar t looks lik e or whether it’ s breakable. Choice C is incorr ect because
“inevitable ” means impossible t o avoid, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in this context. The text doesn ’t discuss the lik elihood of
artists, or any one else, gaining access t o video camer as. Choice D is incorr ect because “habitual” means doing something
regularly or r epeatedly . Although the text does suggest that Jenkins cr eated multiple pieces of video ar t, its focus is on the fact
that video camer as had only just become widely a vailable t o artists in the 1970s. Jenkins’ s ability t o tak e adv antage of video
camer as to mak e art was ther efore newfound, not habitual, at the time.

ID: 662ebff2  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined por tion in the text as a whole. The
text establishes that many countries ha ve adopted risk-disclosur e requir ements for ﬁnancial pr oducts due t o concerns that
consumers don ’t understand the risks associated with the pr oducts. Accor ding t o the text, Seir a et al. found that the eff ects of
such messaging on consumer beha vior wer e small and tempor ary. The text then adds that the r esear chers asser t that because
the cost of the messaging is negligible, the appr oach ma y be wor th doing e ven if the eff ects ar e limited. Thus, the underlined
portion notes a fact or—v ery low cost—that led the r esear chers t o not completely dismiss risk-disclosur e messaging despite their
evidence of its limited utility .
Choice B is incorr ect because the underlined por tion doesn ’t refer to a par ticular type of risk-disclosur e messaging, whether Seir a
et al. consider ed it or not; the underlined por tion simply indicates that the cost of the messaging (br oadly) is v ery low , which
mak es the appr oach wor th pursuing e ven if its eff ects ar e limited. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the underlined por tion does
describe a consider ation that led the r esear chers t o recommend risk-disclosur e messaging despite the messaging’ s small eff ects
on consumer beha vior, it dir ectly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or v ery low—meaning that both the eff ects
and the costs ar e small, not that the eff ects ar e small only r elativ e to the costs. Choice D is incorr ect because ther e’s no indication
that Seir a et al. suggest that risk-disclosur e messaging could be mor e eff ectiv e if it had lower costs; r ather , the underlined por tion
indicates that Seir a et al. belie ve the alr eady negligible cost of messaging mak es the appr oach wor th pursuing e ven if its eff ects
are limited.

Africa ’s Sahar a region—once a lush ecosystem—began t o dry out about 8,000 y ears ago. A change in Ear th’s orbit that aff ected
climate has been posited as a cause of deser tiﬁcation, but ar chaeologist Da vid W right also attributes the shift t o Neolithic
peoples. He cites their adoption of past oralism as a fact or in the r egion dr ying out: the past oralists’ liv estock depleted v egetation,
prompting the e vents that cr eated the Sahar a Deser t.
Text 2
Resear ch b y Chris Brierle y et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed t o the Sahar a’s deser tiﬁcation. Using a
climate-v egetation model, the team concluded that the end of the r egion ’s humid period occurr ed 500 y ears earlier than pr eviously

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . Brierle y et al. ’s resear ch dir ectly challenges W right’ s claim that past oralism turned the Sahar a int o a
deser t, suggesting that, in a Sahar a that turned arid 500 y ears earlier than pr eviously thought, past oral pr actices ma y have actually
“preser ved vegetation ” rather than depleting it.
Choice B is incorr ect. Brierle y et al. ’s resear ch actually disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples’ beha viors, including
past oralism, could ha ve contributed t o the Sahar a’s changing climate. In fact, their r esear ch implies that the Neolithic peoples’
practices did not “ exacerbate aridity ” (i.e., mak e things worse), but ma y have slowed envir onmental changes. Choice C is incorr ect.
Brierle y et al. ’s resear ch does not acknowledge that past oralism can ha ve deleterious (i.e., negativ e) eff ects on a r egion ’s

ID: 47598085  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the ﬁrst sentence functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst
sentence intr oduces what y awn contagion is, explaining that it occurs when an individual y awns in r esponse t o the y awn of
another individual. The text goes on t o describe Elisabetta P alagi and her colleagues’ study of this phenomenon in a wild
population of gelada monk eys. Accor ding t o the text, the study showed that wild primate populations experience y awn contagion
and that the beha vior occurs most commonly in male monk eys and acr oss social gr oups. Thus, the function of the ﬁrst sentence
is to deﬁne the phenomenon of y awn contagion that is discussed in the text.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the ﬁrst sentence intr oduces the text’ s discussion of y awn contagion, it doesn ’t present this
beha vior, or anything else, as a pr oblem. Choice C is incorr ect because the ﬁrst sentence doesn ’t present a claim but instead
explains what y awn contagion is. Mor eover, the text doesn ’t challenge anything; it’ s an informativ e text that describes the ﬁndings
of a r esear ch study about y awning in wild primate populations. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text describes a scientiﬁc

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of self-contr ol in cuttleﬁsh. In this context,
"competent" means capable. The text describes a study in which cuttleﬁsh demonstr ated an ability t o exercise r estraint b y waiting

Choice A is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstr ating self-contr ol, cuttleﬁsh ar e "awkwar d," or lacking
skill or gr ace. If anything, the text indicates that cuttleﬁsh appear t o be surprisingly skilled at ex ercising self-contr ol. Choice B is
incorr ect because in this context, "imaginativ e" would mean cr eativ e, and ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that cuttleﬁsh
demonstr ate cr eativity . Instead, the text focuses on the fact that cuttleﬁsh seem t o be capable of ex ercising r estraint and self-

indicates that the cuttleﬁsh in the study demonstr ated r estraint b y waiting for a fa vorite tr eat instead of de vouring a r eadily

Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of r esidential mobility decisions. In this
context, " mediated b y" means inﬂuenced or aff ected b y something. The text establishes that incr easing household spending
power (an economic fact or) pr oduced " mixed eff ects" on mobility decisions. The text then explains that r esidential choices ar e
"not fully r educible t o economic fact ors," which means that these decisions don ’t simply r ely on how much mone y is a vailable t o
spend on a r esidential mo ve but on other fact ors as well. Accor ding t o the text, noneconomic consider ations, such as access t o
social networks, also pla y a signiﬁcant r ole. Thus, " mediated b y" accur ately captur es this r elationship wher e noneconomic fact ors
inﬂuence what might other wise be pur ely economic decisions.
Choice A is incorr ect because "tr ansposed with " would suggest that economic and noneconomic fact ors ar e being switched or
inter changed when making r esidential mobility decisions, which wouldn ’t mak e logical sense in this context. The text indicates
that these fact ors coexist and jointly inﬂuence such decisions. Choice C is incorr ect. The phr ase " decoupled fr om" means
separ ated or disconnected fr om, which would suggest that economic fact ors ar e completely separ ate fr om noneconomic fact ors.
This would contr adict the text’ s main point that r esidential mobility decisions inv olve multiple fact ors being consider ed
simultaneously r ather than in isolation. Choice D is incorr ect because " antecedent t o," which means something prior or earlier ,
would indicate that noneconomic fact ors come befor e economic ones in time or sequence. The text doesn ’t establish this
chronological r elationship. Instead, the text indicates that economic fact ors (household spending power) and noneconomic
factors (access t o social networks) simultaneously inﬂuence r esidential mobility decisions.

umami ﬂa vor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O’Mahony used br oths made fr om shiitak e mushr ooms and kombu seaweed, and
two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agr eed on a description of the taste.

A 2022 experiment b y Manon Jünger et al. led t o a gr eater understanding of so y sauce ’s ﬂa vor pr oﬁle. The team initially pr esented
a mixtur e of compounds with low molecular weights t o taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as r eal so y sauce.
Further analysis of so y sauce identiﬁed pr oteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami ﬂa vor and also contributed t o
saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that r e-created so y sauce ’s ﬂa vor.

Choice D is the best answer . Ishii and O’Mahony wer e trying t o isolate the pur e umami ﬂa vor, while Jünger was tr ying t o recreate
soy sauce, which has a mix of ﬂa vors that includes umami. Accor dingly , the br oths fr om Text 1 ar e not described as ha ving any

Choice A is incorr ect. Neither text suppor ts this. Neither text gets int o the diets of people in the United States, nor the diets of

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Olga Tokar czuk’ s no vel The Books of

Choice A is incorr ect. Although the wor d “accur acy,” or being fr ee fr om err or or falsehood, can sometimes be used t o describe a
novel, the text doesn ’t discuss whether Tokar czuk’ s no vel has this quality . Instead, the text describes the no vel as ha ving a lar ge
cast of char acters, a diﬃcult-t o-follow plot, and r everse page numbering. These f eatur es suggest complexity , not accur acy. Choice
B is incorr ect because “inactivity ” means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would mak e sense in this
context. The text describes Tokar czuk’ s no vel, and although it’ s possible the no vel could por tray its char acters as inactiv e, it
wouldn ’t mak e sense t o describe the no vel itself as such. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context “r estraint” would mean

Micr obes ar e tiny or ganisms in the soil, water , and air all ar ound us. They thriv e even in v ery harsh conditions. That’ s why Noah
Fierer and colleagues wer e surprised when soil samples the y collected fr om an extr emely cold, dr y area in Antar ctica didn ’t seem
to contain any lif e. The ﬁnding doesn ’t prove that ther e are no micr obes in that ar ea, but the team sa ys it does suggest that the
envir onment se verely restricts micr obes’ sur vival.
 
Text 2
Micr obes ar e found in vir tually e very envir onment on Ear th. So it’ s unlik ely the y would be completely absent fr om Fier er’s team ’s
study site, no matter how extr eme the envir onment is. Ther e wer e probably so f ew or ganisms in the samples that curr ent
technology couldn ’t detect them. But since a spoonful of typical soil elsewher e might contain billions of micr obes, the pr esence of
so few in the Antar ctic soil samples would show how challenging the conditions ar e.
Based on the texts, Fier er’s team and the author of Text 2 would most lik ely agr ee with which statement about micr obes?
A. Most micr obes ar e better able t o sur vive in envir onments with extr emely dr y conditions than in envir onments with harsh
temper atures.
B. A much higher number of micr obes would pr obably be found if another sample of soil wer e tak en fr om the Antar ctic study site.
C. Micr obes ar e likely diﬃcult t o detect in the soil at the Antar ctic study site because the y tend t o be smaller than micr obes found
in typical soil elsewher e.
D. Most micr obes ar e probably unable t o withstand the soil conditions at the Antar ctic study site.

Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it pr esents a statement about micr obes with which Fier er’s team (T ext 1) and the author of
Text 2 would most lik ely agr ee. Text 1 states that micr obes usually thriv e in v ery harsh conditions, and so Fier er’s team was
surprised when samples collected fr om an extr emely cold and dr y area of Antar ctica didn ’t appear t o contain any lif e. Fier er’s team
says that though this doesn ’t conclusiv ely pr ove ther e are no micr obes in the ar ea, it suggests that micr obes would ha ve a notably
diﬃcult time sur viving in the envir onment. The author of Text 2 sa ys it’ s unlik ely that ther e would be no micr obes at all in the
Antar ctic study site fr om which Fier er’s team r etrie ved soil samples and that ther e ma y have been har d-to-detect micr obes in the
samples. Howe ver, the pr esence of only a f ew micr obes in the Antar ctic samples r ather than the billions found in a typical soil
sample (which would pr esumably be much easier t o detect) would illustr ate conditions in the Antar ctic soil that mak e it diﬃcult
for micr obes t o thriv e. Since Fier er’s team sa ys that the seeming absence of micr obes in the Antar ctic samples suggests an
unusually harsh envir onment and the author of Text 2 sa ys that e ven if ther e are a f ew undetectable micr obes in the samples, the
relativ ely tiny number of micr obes would also suggest an unusually harsh envir onment, then Fier er’s team and the author of Text 2
would most lik ely agr ee that most micr obes ar e unable t o withstand the soil conditions at the Antar ctic study site.
Choice A is incorr ect. The samples tak en b y Fier er’s team wer e from an ar ea of Antar ctica that is described in par t as extr emely
dry, and these samples didn ’t appear t o ha ve any lif e. Ther efore, even though these samples also came fr om an extr emely cold
area, Fier er’s team wouldn ’t argue based on the e vidence a vailable that micr obes wer e better able t o sur vive in dr y conditions than
in ar eas with harsh temper atures. Mor eover, the author of Text 2 sa ys that micr obes ar e found in vir tually e very envir onment on

another collection of samples fr om the Antar ctic study site might yield diff erent r esults fr om the samples alr eady tak en b y Fier er’s
team. The author of Text 2 does state that micr obes ar e found in vir tually e very envir onment on Ear th and suggests that new
technology ma y be better able t o detect so f ew micr obes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual
absence of micr obes in the Antar ctic samples is e vidence of the harsh Antar ctic envir onment. Ther efore, ther e is no r eason t o
belie ve that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample dr awn fr om that same harsh envir onment would yield a much higher
number of micr obes. Choice C is incorr ect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that ther e ma y have been so f ew micr obes in the
Antar ctic samples that curr ent technology couldn ’t detect them, but the author doesn ’t speculate that this is due t o the siz e of the
micr obes. Mor eover, nothing that Fier er’s team sa ys suggests that the y are speculating that their samples might ha ve micr obes

A. Demanding
B. Signaling
C. Inviting
D. Shifting
ID: 9ccf463e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “beckoning” most nearly means “inviting, ” or attr activ e. The text por trays
a woman who is looking at “tr ees in their spring beauty .” She compar es them t o cities, which ha ve their own pleasur es even if the y
do not ha ve the “ easy unhuman lo veliness” of tr ees: she thinks of cities as “ seductiv e” and “ charming, ” both adjectiv es that signify
something that is enticing, or attr activ e. Ther efore, cities that ar e seductiv e and charming would also be described as inviting
people closer t o them.
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e is no indication in this context that cities ar e “demanding, ” or r equiring effor t. Choice B is
incorr ect. Though “ signaling, ” or communicating something, might be consider ed a k ey featur e of the act of “beckoning, ” in the
context her e, “beckoning” suggests that cities ha ve attr activ e qualities that natur ally dr aw people t o them. Such attr activ e qualities
are not described b y the wor d “signaling” alone. Ther efore, “signaling” is an incorr ect answer because it is insuﬃciently pr ecise.
Choice D is incorr ect because ther e is no r eason t o think in this context that the cities ar e “shifting, ” or changing shape.

Historians studying pr e-Inca P eru ha ve look ed to cer amic v essels t o understand daily lif e among the Moche people. These mold-

Art hist orian and ar chaeologist Lisa Trever has ar gued that the interpr etation of Moche “ portrait” v essels as hyper-r ealistic
portrayals of identiﬁable people ma y inadv ertently disr egar d the cr eativity of the objects’ cr eators. Moche cer amic v essels, Trever

B. It is lik ely that some depictions of human faces with extensiv e markings ar e intended t o por tray the same hist orical individual.
C. Some v essels ma y have been damaged during their ex cavation and thus pr ovide little insight int o Moche cultur e.
D. Markings on depictions of human faces ar e not necessarily intended t o por tray par ticular details about the physical

Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . Trever thinks that the “hyper-r ealistic por trayal of identiﬁable people ” interpr etation ignor es the
sculpt ors’ imagination and cr eativity . We can inf er that Trevor thinks the facial markings on the sculptur es ma y not ha ve
represented r eal skin blemishes on r eal people.
Choice A is incorr ect. The text giv es us no r eason t o think that Trever would r espond t o the underlined interpr etation in this wa y.
Neither text compar es the depictions of human faces t o the depictions of plants or animals, so we ha ve no basis t o draw this
conclusion. Choice B is incorr ect. The text giv es us no r eason t o think that Trever would r espond t o the underlined interpr etation in
this wa y. Ther e’s nothing in either text about multiple depictions r epresenting the same person, so we ha ve no basis t o draw this
conclusion. Choice C is incorr ect. The text giv es us no r eason t o think that Trever would r espond t o the underlined interpr etation in

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. a haphazar d
B. a contentious
C. an ineff ectual
D. an ar duous
ID: af4300b0  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the cr eation of The Adv entur es of Prince
Achmed.  In this context, " arduous" means that the pr ocess is mark ed b y great labor or effor t. Accor ding t o the text, the cr eation of
the 1926 animated ﬁlm The Adv entur es of Prince Achmed  took thr ee years and was a painstaking pr ocess. Since the pr ocess was
so long and r equir ed gr eat effor ts by Lotte Reiniger and her team, the cr eation of the ﬁlm was ther efore an ar duous pr ocess.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that the cr eation of Reiniger ’s ﬁlm was " a haphazar d," or disor ganiz ed,
process. In fact, the text suggests that the cr eation pr ocess was quite meticulous and the team work ed har d together t o produce
the envisioned eff ects. Choice B is incorr ect. While the text does suggest that the cr eation of Reiniger ’s ﬁlm was a long and
diﬃcult pr ocess, it doesn ’t suggest that the pr ocess was " a contentious" one, or one causing contr oversy or ar gument. The text
suggests that the team work ed together t o produce the envisioned eff ects. Choice C is incorr ect because r ather than describing
the pr ocess of cr eating the ﬁlm as "ineff ectual, " or not ha ving the eff ect it was intended t o ha ve, the text describes the pr ocess as
ultimately successful despite the diﬃculty it inv olved.

ID: ca47273b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . “Spans” means “ extends o ver a distance of ” or “ encompasses. ” Since we ’re talking about the world’ s
largest plant, it mak es sense t o sa y that it “ spans” about 200 squar e kilometers.
Choice A is incorr ect. “ Acknowledges” means “r ecogniz es” or “ admits the truth of. ” Either wa y, it doesn ’t mak e sense her e: a plant

D. It presents e vidence that calls int o question the pr evious sentence ’s char acterization of Johnson ’s artistic de velopment. 
ID: 4c4db685  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole.
The ﬁrst sentence of the text indicates that Johnson r eturned t o the US in 1938 at which time his painting style suddenly changed.
The second sentence is underlined and giv es mor e detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted lar gely
of landscapes in an expr essionist style and his new works wer e highly styliz ed por traits of Black Americans. In other wor ds, the
function of the underlined sentence is t o elabor ate on a tr ansitional moment in Johnson ’s painting car eer.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text does mention that Johnson spent a decade in E urope, it does not discuss what other tr avel
Johnson might ha ve done. F urthermor e, although the text mentions African, American, and Scandina vian ar tistic elements in
Johnson ’s work, it does not indicate that he tr aveled t o diff erent locations t o learn about these pr actices. Choice C is incorr ect
because the text does not focus on Johnson ’s personal lif e nor does it addr ess how successful his car eer was in gener al. Choice

ID: cf46f239  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined por tion in the text as a whole. The text
describes the failed attempt of Isr ael P otter t o establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth centur y: accor ding t o his
contr act, he was t o receiv e two hundr ed acr es in ex change for thr ee months’ work, but his emplo yer then r efused t o fulﬁll the

that though Isr ael was "br ave-hear ted, and e ven much of a dar e-de vil upon a pinch, " he also possessed " a singular patience and
mildness. " In other wor ds, Isr ael could be cour ageous in cer tain cir cumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined t o

if not for a cer tain aspect of his char acter , Israel might not ha ve been as easily thwar ted in his ambition t o establish a farm.
Choice A is incorr ect because although the underlined por tion describes aspects of Isr ael’s personality , it does not addr ess how he

circumstances, it does not sa y that he under took acts of cour age that others a voided, but r ather that he was habitually meek. E ven
if the underlined por tion did sa y that Isr ael was mor e cour ageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under

ID: 69a6d050  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the writing system cr eated b y Sequo yah.
In this context, “ widespr ead” means widely accepted or pr acticed. The text indicates that because Sequo yah’s script accur ately
represented the spok en sounds of the Cher okee language and was easy t o learn, nearly all Cher okee people wer e able t o read and
write it soon after it was cr eated. This context demonstr ates that the script was widely used b y the Cher okee people.
Choice B is incorr ect. In this context, “ careful” would mean ex ercised with car e and attentiv e concern. Although the work of
creating a writing system lik ely inv olved gr eat car e, the text indicates that the system was “ easy t o learn, ” which conﬂicts with the
idea that using this system r equir es a notewor thy amount of car e. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context “unintended”
means not deliber ate. The idea that using Sequo yah’s script was unintentional conﬂicts dir ectly with the claim that it was easy t o
learn and used b y “over 90% of the Cher okee people ” by 1830. In fact, because one had t o learn this system, it’ s not clear how one
could use it unintentionally . Choice D is incorr ect because in this context “infr equent” means r are or not occurring often, which

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents the best description of the o verall structur e of the text. The text begins b y stating
that companies ar e incr easingly giving consumers oppor tunities t o cust omiz e products, allowing them t o mak e design choices
when buying cer tain sneak ers, jewelr y, and clothing. The text then indicates that although this tr end beneﬁts companies because
they can successfully char ge buy ers mor e for cust omiz ed pr oducts and don ’t ha ve to rush pr oduction, it also poses a challenge
because pr oducing unique items ma y requir e diff erent and mor e expensiv e methods than the ones typically used for mass
production, r aising the companies’ costs. Thus, the text ﬁrst intr oduces a tr end in consumer pr oducts and then explains how the
trend both beneﬁts and poses a challenge t o companies.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t present the cust omization of v arious pr oducts as a r ecent inno vation—the fact that
there are "more oppor tunities" now indicates that ther e wer e oppor tunities befor e—and no other inno vations, in pr oduct
manufacturing or other wise, ar e discussed. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t discuss any par ticular company or

Although the text discusses companies off ering something that consumers lik e and ar e willing t o pa y mor e for—the ability t o

Italian painters in the 1500s r arely depicted themselv es in their work. E ven mor e rare wer e self-por trait paintings that por trayed the
artist as a painter . At the time, painting was not y et respected as a pr ofession, so painters mostly chose t o emphasiz e other

Text 2
In their self-por traits, Bolognese ar tists typically a voided r eferring t o the act of painting until the mid-1600s. Howe ver, Lavinia
Fontana ’s 1577 painting, Self-P ortrait at the K eyboar d, stands out as the earliest example of such a work b y an ar tist fr om Bologna.

A. Carracci and F ontana wer e among the most well-r espected painters in Bologna at the time.
B. The depiction of F ontana in Self-P ortrait at the K eyboar d was intended t o underscor e the ar tist’s creativity .
C. Fontana lik ely inspir ed the r eference t o an easel and palette in Carr acci’ s painting.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The author of Text 2 states that F ontana ’s painting, which depicts a painting easel in the back ground,

Choice A is incorr ect. The texts don ’t suppor t this choice. Neither text mentions the r eputation or status of either Carr acci or

Very little is known about the r ole nocturnal insects, such as moths, pla y in ﬂower pollination because it is diﬃcult t o monit or
insects at night. To addr ess this pr oblem, a team of scientists used time-lapse camer as to recor d pollinat or visits t o red clo ver all
day and night.  The r ecor dings showed that while most pollinat or visits wer e by bumblebees, one-thir d of visits wer e by moths.
Additionally , ﬂowers that wer e visited b y both moths and bees pr oduced mor e seeds than ﬂowers that wer e only visited b y bees.
Which choice best states the function of the underlined sentence? 
A. To describe an appr oach a team of scientists used t o study pollinat ors 
B. To question a claim scientists mak e about pollinat ors 
C. To explain why moths pr efer red clo ver to other ﬂowers
D. To announce an unexpected r esear ch ﬁnding about r ed clo ver 
ID: 617a8a10  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined sentence. The sentence indicates
that scientists used time-lapse phot ography during both da y and night t o detect pollinat ors visiting r ed clo ver. Ther efore, the
underlined sentence has the function of describing an appr oach scientists used in the pollinat or study discussed in the text.
Choice B is incorr ect because the underlined sentence discusses equipment the scientists used t o conduct their study , and the
text pr ovides nothing t o suggest these elements of their experimental design could, b y themselv es, question claims r esulting fr om
the study . Choice C is incorr ect because nothing in either the underlined sentence or the r est of the text addr esses whether moths
have a pr eference for r ed clo ver or any other ﬂowers. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the sentences that follow the underlined
sentence discuss r esear ch ﬁndings, nothing in the text suggests that these ﬁndings wer e unexpected. Mor eover, the underlined
sentence describes par t of the scientists’ experimental design (da y and night time-lapse phot ography), not a ﬁnding of the
scientists’ study .

ID: e41dfaab  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of letters allegedly ex changed between
President Lincoln and Rutledge. In this context, “v alidate ” means t o conﬁrm that something is r eal or corr ect. Accor ding t o the text,
it was alleged, or claimed, that the newly disco vered letters had been written b y Lincoln and Rutledge. The text also indicates that
historians ultimately decided the letters wer e a hoax, or fr audulent. This context suggests that the hist orians couldn ’t conﬁrm that
the letters wer e authentic.
Choice B is incorr ect. The text focuses on the authenticity of the letters, which wer e claimed t o ha ve been written b y Lincoln and
Rutledge and wer e then quickly dismissed as fr audulent b y hist orians. Rather than conv eying that the hist orians simply wer en’t
able t o “interpr et,” or explain in an understandable wa y, the letters’ authenticity , the text suggests that the hist orians decided the
letters lack ed authenticity alt ogether . Choice C is incorr ect. The text states that the hist orians quickly dismissed the letters
claimed t o ha ve been written b y Lincoln and Rutledge as fr audulent; this suggests that r ather than being unable t o “relate, ” or tell
others about, the letters’ authenticity , the hist orians wer e able t o shar e what the y’d decided about the letters. Choice D is incorr ect
because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o suggest that the hist orians couldn ’t “accommodate, ” or giv e consider ation t o, the authenticity
of the letters claimed t o ha ve been written b y Lincoln and Rutledge; the text states that the hist orians decided that the letters wer e

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The pr evious sentence br oadly mentions " autobiogr aphies written b y the fr eedom seek ers." This
sentence identiﬁes Loguen ’s aut obiogr aphy as a speciﬁc example.
Choice B is incorr ect. The sentence ne ver explains why Loguen chose t o write about his experiences. Choice C is incorr ect. The
previous sentence identiﬁes aut obiogr aphies as useful sour ces of hist orical information about a speciﬁc t opic, but not for

Why do sand cats purr but lions r oar? Resear chers hypothesiz e that this diff erence between the two f eline species ma y be par tly
due t o a U-shaped bone in their thr oats called the hy oid. Sand cats, which ar e much smaller than lions, ha ve a rigid hy oid that
rumbles when the cat’ s lar ynx vibr ates, r esulting in a purr . By contr ast, lions ha ve a somewhat ﬂexible hy oid, and the bone is

ID: 190857f0  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the o verall structur e of the text. The text begins b y posing a question about
two diff erent cat species: "Why do sand cats purr but lions r oar?" The r emainder of the text then pr esents a possible answer t o this
question b y explaining a hypothesis about diff erences in these cats’ hy oid bone structur e. The text details how sand cats ha ve
rigid hy oids that pr oduce purring sounds when their lar ynx vibr ates, while lions ha ve mor e ﬂexible hy oids attached t o the skull with
a str etchy ligament that enables r oaring but ma y prevent purring.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t present facts that weak en the theor y about two cat species; r ather , it asks a
question about two species and then discusses a potential answer . Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t discuss the
habitats of sand cats and lions at all, nor does it mention any changes t o their habitats. Choice C is incorr ect because the text

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the collabor ation between the Cr ow Tribe

Montana State Univ ersity collabor ation ser ves to illustr ate the model of community-based par ticipat ory resear ch intr oduced earlier
in the text and expanded on later in the text. 
Choice A is incorr ect because r eferring t o “circumv ents, ” or a voids, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text suggests that the

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how a data-tr ansf er pr oject aff ected data
from equipment fr om the Apollo Moon landings. In this context, " available " means accessible or able t o be used. The text explains
that the Apollo equipment is still on the Moon, but the data it collected " were mostly inaccessible " until a data-tr ansf er pr oject was
under taken. The text then states that this pr oject allowed a r esear cher t o use the information that has been collected. This context
mak es it clear that the pr oject made pr eviously inaccessible data a vailable, or accessible.
Choice A is incorr ect because sa ying that a pr oject made data fr om the Apollo equipment on the Moon " predictable " would mean
that the data could be known or declar ed in adv ance, and it’ s not clear how that would be achie ved, par ticularly with data that had
been " mostly inaccessible " befor e the pr oject. Rather than suggesting that the data-tr ansf er pr oject made the data pr edictable, the
text conv eys that it made the data a vailable t o be used as sour ces of information. Choice B is incorr ect because the sentence
indicates that data fr om the Apollo equipment on the Moon wer e "mostly inaccessible " until a r ecent data-tr ansf er pr oject did

ID: 5effa190  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion about r ecycling plastics. In this context,
“inadequate ” means not satisfact ory. The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-r ecycling pr ocess aff ects the envir onment and
causes “the loss of material quality .” The text contr asts that with Chaz ovachii’ s chemical plastic-r ecycling pr ocess, which is
cleaner and pr oduces a desir able pr oduct. The text’ s emphasis on the negativ e aspects of mechanical r ecycling suggests that it is
inadequate in terms of envir onmental impact and the quality of the material the pr ocess yields.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context “r esilient” would mean able t o withstand diﬃculty and the text does not char acteriz e
the plastic-r ecycling pr ocess as ha ving this quality or describe any diﬃculties that these pr ocesses might need t o overcome.
Choice C is incorr ect because in this context “ dynamic ” would mean constantly changing. Although the text suggests that ther e
have been changes in the ﬁeld of r ecycling, as is the case with the adv ent of Chaz ovachii’ s chemical r ecycling pr ocess, ther e is
nothing t o suggest that the mechanical pr ocess itself has changed or is pr one t o change. Choice D is incorr ect because in this
context “ satisfact ory” would mean acceptable but not per fect. The text mentions only shor tcomings of the mechanical pr ocess

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how pr edat ors f eed their y oung. As used
in this context, " provide" means supply or mak e something that’ s needed a vailable. The text indicates that some pr edat ors supply
prey for their y oung b y either lea ving dead pr ey nearb y or b y bringing liv e prey to them. Other pr edat ors, the text states, f eed their

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the ﬂashes cr eated b y ﬁreﬂies. In this
context, “ patterns” means distinct and pr edictable sequences. The text indicates that although the ﬂashes that ﬁr eﬂies pr oduce
appear t o occur r andomly—that is, without any par ticular sequence or rhythm—each species actually pr oduces its own special
series of ﬂashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of ﬂashes ar e so unique that ﬁr eﬂies can use them t o ﬁnd other members of
their species. Ther efore, this context suppor ts the idea that ﬁr eﬂies pr oduce ﬂashes in distinct and r ecognizable patterns.
Choice A is incorr ect because “ quantities” means cer tain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how
different ﬁr eﬂy species pr oduce ﬂashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species t o ﬁnd them, it
doesn ’t mention the number of ﬂashes that ar e used in these sequences. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context,
“decor ations” would mean things that mak e an object mor e beautiful. Although it ma y be r easonable t o sa y that ﬁr eﬂy ﬂashes ar e
beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that ﬁr eﬂies use these unique sequences of ﬂashes t o ﬁnd other members of their own
species, not that the ﬂashes mak e ﬁreﬂies mor e beautiful. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context, “ agreements” would r efer

Text 2
Past studies of white dwar f atmospher es ha ve concluded that cer tain ex oplanets had continental crusts. Geologist K eith Putirka
and astr onomer Siyi X u argue that those studies unduly emphasiz e atmospheric tr aces of lithium and other individual elements as

Choice C is the best answer because it r eﬂects how Putirka and X u (Text 2) would lik ely char acteriz e the conclusion pr esented in
Text 1. Text 1 discusses a study b y Mark Holland and colleagues in which the y detected tr aces of lithium and sodium in the

Earth’s once orbited these stars. Text 2 intr oduces Putirka and X u, who indicate that sodium and lithium ar e present in se veral
different miner als and that some of those miner als might exist in types of r ock that ar e not found on Ear th. Ther efore, Putirka and
Xu would lik ely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium ar e also

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the Indigenous method of har vesting
Hierochloe odor ata. As used in this context, “r eplenishes” means helps incr ease the population or helps it r ecover. The text
explains that although snapping off a wild plant at the r oot might seem detrimental t o the wild population, it actually helps

Choice A is incorr ect. Although a har vesting method could be used t o select for cer tain tr aits in plants, it’ s not clear what it would

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the sounds made b y güir os. In this
context, “v ariable ” means able t o change. The text begins b y explaining that güir os ar e instruments made out of hollowed gour ds
with ridges cut int o their sides and that pla yers scr ape the ridges with wooden sticks t o produce sounds. The text goes on t o sa y
that güir os’ sounds can change depending on gour d thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of str okes the pla yer
uses, thus suppor ting the idea that the sounds cr eated b y these instruments ar e variable.
Choice A is incorr ect because “ overlook ed” means not being seen or noticed, and ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that the
sounds pr oduced b y güir os ar e overlook ed or not noticed. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, “ power ful” would mean
having a gr eat ability t o produce an eff ect. While it’ s possible that the sounds pr oduced b y güir os ha ve a str ong eff ect on listeners,
the text doesn ’t discuss this aspect of their sounds. Choice C is incorr ect because “r outine ” means usual and unv arying, and ther e
is nothing in the text t o suggest that the sounds pr oduced b y güir os ar e unv arying. In fact, the text describes how the sounds
produced b y güir os can diff er based on se veral fact ors.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the challenge of gener ating electricity
from ocean wa ves. In this context, " consistent" means steady or unchanging o ver time. The text intr oduces a challenge and then
explains that wa ve power v aries, or changes, unpr edictably in wa ys that cause pr oblems for electricity gener ation. This context
conv eys that the challenge being described is a lack of consistency .
Choice A is incorr ect because the text intr oduces a challenge and then elabor ates on it b y emphasizing that the unpr edictable
natur e of v ariations in ocean wa ves causes pr oblems, which doesn ’t indicate that wa ve power isn ’t "accidental, " or isn ’t happening
unintentionally . It wouldn ’t mak e sense t o describe wa ves—a natur al occurr ence—as happening intentionally . Choice B is incorr ect
because " conﬁdent" means ha ving a f eeling of self-assur ance, and it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o describe wa ve power itself in terms
of either ha ving or lacking a sense of conﬁdence. Choice C is incorr ect because the text intr oduces a challenge and then
elabor ates on it b y emphasizing that the unpr edictable natur e of v ariations in ocean wa ves causes pr oblems, which doesn ’t
indicate that wa ve power isn ’t "expensiv e," or isn ’t costly . If anything, technological and planning pr oblems might actually incr ease

Some studies ha ve suggested that postur e can inﬂuence cognition, but we should not o verstate this phenomenon. A case in point:
In a 2014 study , Megan O’Brien and Alaa Ahmed had subjects stand or sit while making risky simulated economic decisions.
Standing is mor e physically unstable and cognitiv ely demanding than sitting; accor dingly , O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesiz ed that
standing subjects would displa y mor e risk a version during the decision-making tasks than sitting subjects did, since the y would
want t o avoid fur ther f eelings of discomfor t and complicated risk e valuations. But O’Brien and Ahmed actually found no diff erence

ID: c61a7c4a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some
studies ha ve suggested that postur e ma y have an eff ect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be o verstated. In other wor ds,
the text begins b y urging caution and r estraint when discussing the eff ects of postur e on cognition, implying that e ven though
some studies ha ve shown postur e to aff ect cognition, we should not assume that postur e alwa ys aff ects cognition or does so in a
strong wa y. The text goes on t o discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’ s study as a " case in point" (that is, as an example of the point made
previously). Accor ding t o the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesiz ed that since standing is mor e cognitiv ely demanding than sitting,
standing subjects in their experiment would r espond diff erently t o decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would
show an eff ect of postur e on cognition. What the r esear chers actually found, howe ver, was that the standing and sitting subjects
performed the same—postur e did not aff ect cognition. By pr esenting a cir cumstance in which postur e does not appear t o aff ect
cognition, the discussion of O’Brien and Ahmed’ s study shows why it is impor tant not t o overstate the phenomenon. The purpose
of the text, ther efore, is t o discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’ s study t o illustr ate why caution is needed when making claims about
postur e’s eff ects on cognition.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’ s study as an example of why caution is needed when
discussing postur e’s eff ects on cognition, not as an example of how r esear ch ﬁndings r elated t o postur e and cognition ar e often
misunderst ood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the r elationship between postur e and
cognition that has been r epor ted in some pr evious studies, O’Brien and Ahmed’ s study is not one of those studies, and ther e is no
suggestion that any one has misunderst ood O’Brien and Ahmed’ s ﬁndings. Choice B is incorr ect because the text mak es no
mention of the methods used in pr evious studies of the eff ects of postur e on cognition. Although the text does ur ge caution when
discussing postur e’s eff ects on cognition, it does not critique the r esults of studies that suggested that postur e can aff ect
cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such r esults should not be exagger ated or tak en too br oadly . Choice C is incorr ectAssessment

D. Transpar ent
ID: 37219ba2  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, " clear " most nearly means tr anspar ent, or see-thr ough. Muir states that
the water beneath the boat " was so clear that it was almost invisible, " suggesting that those on the boat wer e able t o see thr ough
the water and easily obser ve plants and ﬁsh below the sur face.
Choice A is incorr ect. In some contexts " clear " can mean " simple, " or uncomplicated, but Muir is describing the water , and water
isn’t typically described as either simple or complicated. Muir emphasiz es the water ’s transpar ency , not its simplicity . Choice B is
incorr ect. In some contexts " clear " can mean "understandable, " or r easonable or easily compr ehended, but Muir is describing the
water , and it doesn ’t mak e much sense t o describe water as understandable. Muir emphasiz es the water ’s transpar ency , not how
easily the water can be underst ood. Choice C is incorr ect. Although " clear " can mean " obvious, " or easily seen or underst ood, in
some contexts, Muir ’s description emphasiz es that the water " was almost invisible " and that the boat seemed t o be " sustained in

ID: a2f64e58  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined statement functions in the text as a whole.
The underlined statement mentions a categor y of animals that ha ve a f eatur e in common: the y tend t o ha ve ﬁxed geogr aphic
ranges thr oughout their lif etimes. The text then pr esents the speculation of some r esear chers that the Ar ctic woolly mammoth
might also shar e this char acteristic. Howe ver, an examination of the content of str ontium in the str ata (or la yers) of a woolly
mammoth tusk indicated that contr ary to the r esear chers’ hypothesis, the mammoth had an expanding r ange in its envir onment
that contr acted in its last 1.5 y ears of lif e. Thus, the underlined statement discusses a char acteristic shar ed b y cer tain animals in
order t o explain why r esear chers r aised a possibility that turned out not t o be suppor ted b y data described later in the text.
Choice B is incorr ect. Though the underlined statement pr esents a pattern of beha vior (the habit of cer tain animals of sta ying
within a ﬁx ed geogr aphic r ange), the r est of the text does not pr esent a theor y of ex ceptions t o that pattern; r ather , the r esear chers
are mer ely concerned with whether one par ticular animal has beha vior consistent with the pattern. Choice C is incorr ect. Though
the underlined statement does describe a similarity in the beha vior of cer tain animals (their tendency t o sta y within a ﬁx ed
geogr aphic r ange), this is not done in or der t o show why a method described later in the text failed t o show whether another
animal showed that beha vior; r ather , the method of analysis of str ata of a woolly mammoth tusk showed that the mammoth ’s
beha vior was diff erent fr om that of the animals mentioned in the underlined statement. Choice D is incorr ect. Though the
underlined statement mentions a tr ait shar ed b y a number of animals (their ﬁx ed geogr aphic r ange), the r est of the text does not

Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the consequences of r aising the age at
which r etirees begin r eceiving go vernment funds. The text indicates that r aising the age for these funds is usually discussed in
terms of eff ects on fund r ecipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the eff ects on working family members who car e
for retirees. Smythe notes that r aising the age for the funds would incr ease the length of time r etirees ar e dependent on ﬁnancial
assistance fr om working family members. This is suggested t o ha ve an eff ect on wealth cr eation for those work ers, and most
logically , that eff ect would be disadv antageous. Thus, " stymie, " which means t o prevent or gr eatly hinder , is the most logical choice
in context.
Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, " compound" would most nearly mean multiply or gr eatly enhance. The text indicates
that r aising the age at which r etirees ar e eligible for go vernment funds will incr ease the amount of time r etirees ar e dependent on
working family members for ﬁnancial suppor t. This would lik ely ha ve a negativ e rather than a positiv e eff ect on wealth cr eation.
Choice C is incorr ect because in this context, " dispar age" would most nearly mean criticiz e or defame. Nothing in the text
suggests that r aising the age at which r etirees ar e eligible for go vernment funds would defame wealth cr eation among working
adults. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context, " outstrip " would most nearly mean t o exceed, and nothing in the text
indicates that the ﬁnancial suppor t provided t o retirees would ex ceed the amount of wealth these work ers can cr eate. The text
does suggest that work ers pr oviding funds t o retirees works against those work ers’ wealth accumulation, but not that the suppor t

ID: acb852e7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the o verall structur e of the text. First, the speak er describes
obser ving a “ most beautiful” sight: a tr ee (“black cypr ess”) standing out fr om the golden sky behind it, looking lik e a person ’s ﬁnger
“pointing upwar ds” and appearing “ sensitiv e” and “ exquisite. ” Then the speak er wonders about the image ’s meaning, asking why
the ﬁnger is black and why it’ s pointing upwar d. Thus, the text mo ves fr om the speak er’s description of a distinctiv e sight in natur e
to her pondering about what meaning t o attribute t o that sight.
Choice A is incorr ect because the speak er assesses a natur al sight—a “black cypr ess” tr ee standing “ against a gold, gold sky ” like
a pointed ﬁnger—but doesn ’t question the accur acy of her own assessment. Although she wonders why the ﬁnger , which is r eally a
tree, is black and why it’ s pointing, the speak er doesn ’t suggest that her belief that the tr ee resembles a ﬁnger is wr ong. Choice C is
incorr ect. Although the speak er describes seeing a “black cypr ess” tr ee standing “ against a gold, gold sky ” like a pointed ﬁnger ,
she wonders about that natur al image (asking why the ﬁnger , which is r eally a tr ee, is black and why it’ s pointing) and doesn ’t giv e
any indication that any people ar e present in the scene. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the speak er examines and wonders about
one thing in her surr oundings—a “black cypr ess” tr ee standing “ against a gold, gold sky ” like a pointed ﬁnger—she doesn ’t addr ess

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of W ard and colleagues’ ﬁndings. As used in
this context, “innocuous” means mild or unharmful. The text describes the vibr ation and warming that W ard and colleagues used
to alle viate itching as “harmless applications” and goes on t o contr ast these applications with another stimulus that actually
offers mor e relief e ven though it seems t o be str onger and “less benign. ” This context conv eys the idea that vibr ation and warming
were innocuous stimuli. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text focuses on a distinction between harmless stimuli and those that seem t o be less benign.
Nothing in the text suggests that any of the tr eatments ar e “deceptiv e,” or misleading; indeed, e ven the less eff ectiv e ones ar e
described as off ering some r elief. Choice C is incorr ect because the text focuses on the amount of r elief fr om itching off ered b y
harmless stimuli and those that seem t o be less benign. The text doesn ’t suggest that any of these stimuli ar e “novel,” or original
and new; heat, vibr ation, and electricity ar en’t new inv entions. Choice D is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o describe an

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the utility of the Oase 1 fossil t o

Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " exploit" would suggest that the paleoanthr opologists ar e using " steps in the

models of these stellar nurseries.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. repeatable
B. explicable
C. regrettable
D. intangible
ID: 9107ad5c  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how Nia Imar a facilitates the study of
star formations. As used in this context "intangible " means unable t o be physically handled or t ouched. The text states that star
formations cannot be t ouched, and then goes on t o explain that Imar a created a special model t o resear ch star formations. In
other wor ds, despite the fact that r eal star formations ar e intangible, thanks t o Imar a, resear chers can handle models of star
formations t o better understand them.
Choice A is incorr ect because "r epeatable " means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The
text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form ar e unt ouchable, but that Nia Imar a has pr oduced inter activ e
models of them. It would ther efore be illogical t o suggest that Imar a belie ves that the formations need not be duplicated and then
go on t o sa y that she has copied them. Choice B is incorr ect because " explicable " means explainable or understandable, which
wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imar a belie ves that star formations can be fully explained but
rather that she pr oduced inter activ e models t o physically study them because r esear chers ar e unable t o touch them dir ectly .
Choice C is incorr ect because "r egrettable " means distr essing or unfor tunate, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text does
not suggest that Imar a belie ves the r esear chers r egret the star formations or ﬁnd them distr essing, but r ather that she uses

Choice D is the best answer . The underlined sentence pr ovides a concr ete example t o ground r eaders’ understanding of the “ deep

Choice A is incorr ect. Ther e is no e valuation made of A usten ’s skill in this sentence, and no examples ar e giv en in the following
sentence. This choice essentially ﬂips the par agraph: it’ s this ﬁrst sentence that pr ovides an example. Choice B is incorr ect. Ther e

A. impar tial
B. offhand

D. mandat ory
ID: a4ca92f d Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Annie Dodge W auneka ’s work as a Na vajo
Nation legislat or. As used in this context, “ persistent” means existing continuously . The text states that W auneka “ continuously
work ed to promote public health, ” traveling extensiv ely and authoring a medical dictionar y; this indicates that W auneka ’s effor t
was persistent.
Choice A is incorr ect because describing W auneka ’s effor t related t o public health as “impar tial,” or not par tial or biased and
treating all things equally , wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text suggests that W auneka ’s continuous work was par tial in one
way, as she focused speciﬁcally on pr omoting public health thr oughout the Na vajo homeland and t o speak ers of the Na vajo
language. Choice B is incorr ect because the text emphasiz es that W auneka ’s effor t to promote public health as a Na vajo Nation
legislat or was continuous and extensiv e, inv olving wide tr avels and the authoring of a medical dictionar y. Because this work
clearly inv olved car e and dedication, it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o describe it as “ offhand, ” or casual and informal. Choice D is
incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that W auneka ’s effor t to promote public health was “ mandat ory,” or r equir ed b y law
or rule, e ven though W auneka was a Na vajo Nation legislat or. Rather than suggesting that W auneka ’s effor t was r equir ed for any

The idea that time mo ves in only one dir ection is instinctiv ely underst ood, y et it puzzles physicists. Accor ding t o the second law of
thermodynamics, at a macr oscopic le vel some pr ocesses of heat tr ansf er ar e irreversible due t o the pr oduction of entr opy—after a
transf er we cannot r ewind time and place molecules back exactly wher e the y wer e befor e, just as we cannot unbr eak dr opped
eggs. But laws of physics at a micr oscopic or quantum le vel hold that those pr ocesses should  be r eversible.
 
Text 2
In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. per formed an experiment in which the y conﬁrmed the irr eversibility of thermodynamic
processes at a quantum le vel, pr oducing entr opy by applying a r apidly oscillating magnetic ﬁeld t o a system of carbon-13 at oms in
liquid chlor oform. But the experiment “ does not pinpoint ... what causes [irr eversibility] at the micr oscopic le vel,” coauthor Maur o
Paternostr o said.
Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 1 most lik ely sa y about the experiment described in Text 2?
A. It would suggest an inter esting dir ection for futur e resear ch wer e it not the case that two of the physicists who conducted the
experiment disagr ee on the signiﬁcance of its ﬁndings.
B. It provides empirical e vidence that the curr ent understanding of an aspect of physics at a micr oscopic le vel must be
incomplete.
C. It is consistent with the curr ent understanding of physics at a micr oscopic le vel but not at a macr oscopic le vel.
D. It suppor ts a claim about an isolated system of at oms in a labor atory, but that claim should not be extr apolated t o a gener al
claim about the univ erse.
ID: 8de51658  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can ’t solv e: at a micr oscopic le vel, the “laws of
physics” suggest that we should be able t o reverse pr ocesses that ar e not r eversible at a macr oscopic le vel (and, ma ybe, turn back
time!). The experiment conﬁrmed that those pr ocesses ar e not r eversible e ven on the micr oscopic le vel, but it didn ’t explain why .
This suppor ts Author 1’ s point that physicists still don ’t fully understand how things work at a micr oscopic le vel—ma ybe the laws
need t o be r evised.
Choice A is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that the author of Text 1 would r espond this wa y to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of
the physicists inv olved in the experiment, but it ne ver suggests that the y disagr ee on anything. Choice C is incorr ect. This is the
opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment conﬁrmed that the macr oscopic-le vel law (“these things can ’t be
reversed—lik e time ”) was still true on the micr oscopic le vel—meaning it suppor ts the curr ent understanding of physics at a
macr oscopic le vel. Choice D is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that the author of Text 1 would r espond this wa y to the experiment. Neither
text mak es this distinction between labor atory ﬁndings and the wa y the univ erse works in gener al.

ID: e0656211  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s description of how Pico f eels about the natur al world. In
this context, t o sa y that Pico por trays his “ ambiv alence t owar d” natur e would mean that he por trays his mix ed feelings about
natur e. The text explains that Pico “honors the centr ality of natur e” and also mak es it clear that he doesn ’t enjo y being in natur e.
This context suggests that Pico f eels ambiv alence t owar d natur e.
Choice A is incorr ect because sa ying that Pico por trays his “r esponsiv eness t o” natur e would mean that he por trays himself as
quick t o react t o natur e, which isn ’t suppor ted b y the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico ’s mix ed feelings t owar d natur e,
describing him as both honoring natur e’s role in his tribe ’s beliefs and expr essing his personal dislik e for being in natur e. Choice C
is incorr ect because sa ying that Pico por trays his “r enunciation of ” natur e would mean that he por trays himself as r ejecting natur e,
which isn ’t suppor ted b y the text. The text conv eys that Pico demonstr ates both positiv e and negativ e responses t owar d natur e,
not that he ’s giving it up completely . Choice D is incorr ect because sa ying that Pico por trays his “ master y over” natur e would mean
that he por trays himself as ha ving contr ol over natur e, which isn ’t suppor ted b y the text. The text focuses on Pico ’s mix ed feelings

Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately states how the author of Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o the ar gument

graphic no vels tell their st ories, and language is used " only sparingly "—that is, compar atively v ery little—in the form of captions and
dialogue. Howe ver, the author of Text 2 asser ts that language in gr aphic no vels is as equally vital for conv eying meaning as
images ar e, since without captions and dialogue, r eaders wouldn ’t be able t o mak e sense of the narr ative. Mor eover, the author of
Text 2 ar gues that ther e are many gr aphic no vels that ar e "beautifully written " and whose use of language is as accomplished as
any standar d no vel. Because Text 1 ar gues that language is subor dinate t o images in gr aphic no vels, wher eas Text 2 highlights

Choice B is incorr ect. Although Text 1 indicates that gr aphic no vels shouldn ’t be classiﬁed as liter ature based on their limited use
of language, ther e’s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a ﬂaw , just that it doesn ’t ﬁt

What fact ors inﬂuence the abundance of species in a giv en ecological community? Some theorists ha ve argued that hist orical
diversity is a major driv er of how div erse an ecological community e ventually becomes: diff erences in community div ersity acr oss
other wise similar habitats, in this view , are str ongly aff ected b y the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times. 
Text 2
In 2010, a gr oup of r esear chers including biologist Carla Cácer es cr eated ar tiﬁcial pools in a New Y ork for est. They stocked some
pools with a div erse mix of z ooplankt on species and others with a single z ooplankt on species and allowed the pool communities
to de velop natur ally ther eafter . Over the course of four y ears, Cácer es and colleagues periodically measur ed the species div ersity
of the pools, ﬁnding—contr ary to their expectations—that b y the end of the study ther e was little t o no diff erence in the pools’
species div ersity . 
Based on the texts, how would Cácer es and colleagues (T ext 2) most lik ely describe the view of the theorists pr esented in Text 1?
A. It is lar gely corr ect, but it r equir es a minor r eﬁnement in light of the r esear ch team ’s results.

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . This is how Cácer es and co. would most lik ely describe the view pr esented in Text 1. The view in Text
1 is that hist orical div ersity aff ects how div erse an ecological community e ventually becomes. But Cácer es and co. did not get this
result: the y found no diff erence in e ventual div ersity between a z ooplankt on pool that star ted out div erse and a z ooplankt on pool
that star ted out with only a single species.
Choice A is incorr ect. Cácer es and co. would pr obably not describe the view pr esented in Text 1 this wa y. The view in Text 1 is that
historical div ersity aff ects how div erse an ecological community e ventually becomes. Cácer es and co ’s ﬁndings dir ectly
undermine this view: the y found no diff erence in e ventual div ersity between a z ooplankt on pool that star ted out div erse and a
zooplankt on pool that star ted out with only a single species. Choice B is incorr ect. Cácer es and co. would pr obably not describe
the view pr esented in Text 1 this wa y. Their experiment was designed t o test this hypothesis, and their ﬁndings wer e "contr ary to
their expectations. " In other wor ds, befor e the study , they predicted the theor y was corr ect. Choice D is incorr ect. Cácer es and co.
would not describe the view pr esented in Text 1 this wa y. Their r esear ch ﬁnding dir ectly undermines the view pr esented in Text 1:

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the disco very of a car ved wooden ﬁgur e
dating t o around 2,000 y ears ago. In this context, “r arely” means infr equently . The text states that the disco very of the ﬁgur e was
“truly surprising” and notes that wooden objects ar e highly pr one t o rot. This context conv eys the idea that wooden objects
infrequently sur vive for as long as the car ved ﬁgur e has sur vived.
Choice A is incorr ect because “ sturdily” means str ongly , which wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. If wooden objects in gener al could
strongly sur vive for long periods of time, then the disco very of a wooden ﬁgur e that’ s around 2,000 y ears old wouldn ’t be
surprising. Choice B is incorr ect because “ carelessly ” means accidentally . The text conv eys the idea that wooden objects in

Text 2
Cattle farming is a principal cause of global defor estation, and a study b y Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues found that
replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of my copr otein would cut defor estation b y half if accomplished

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it r eﬂects how the author of Text 1 would most lik ely respond t o the study ﬁndings described
in Text 2. The author of Text 2 discusses a study b y Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues that found that defor estation would
be reduced b y half o ver the next thir ty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide wer e replaced with my copr otein. The author
of Text 1 points out that my copr otein is not widely a vailable because of its high pr oduction cost, but goes on t o note that this
problem could be addr essed b y the cr eation of a cheaper substr ate t o feed my copr otein. This suggests that the author of Text 1
would asser t that the de velopment of a less expensiv e my copr otein substr ate would contribute t o the r eduction in defor estation
described in the study ﬁndings discussed in Text 2: if r educing the cost of my copr otein incr eases people ’s access t o it, then
mycopr otein ma y be able t o replace beef in mor e people ’s diets, ther eby reducing the defor estation associated with beef
production.
Choice A is incorr ect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the envir onmental impact of my copr otein pr oduction is close t o
that of chick en or pork pr oduction, so ther e is no r eason t o think that the author would asser t that r eplacing chick en or pork with
mycopr otein would be envir onmentally beneﬁcial: such a r eplacement would not lessen the t otal envir onmental impact of food
manufactur e. Additionally , the speciﬁc issue of agricultur al water consumption is ne ver mentioned in Text 1, so ther e is no
evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would sa y about that issue. Choice C is incorr ect. Although Text 1 does compar e the

ID: fb8b56bc  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main purpose of the text, which is t o show that Henr y’s mother ,
Mrs. Higgins, wants Henr y to lea ve her house. In the text, Mrs. Higgins complains that Henr y off ends all her friends and that the y
stop coming when he ’s also visiting. She then tells him dir ectly , "you mustn ’t sta y." The o verall ex change conv eys Mrs. Higgins’ s
intention for Henr y to lea ve so as not t o driv e awa y her friends with his beha vior.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate what Henr y’s mother does when she ’s out with her friends. Instead, it
focuses on what goes on when Henr y and her friends visit her at the same time, indicating that since her friends ﬁnd Henr y’s
company disagr eeable, she wishes him t o lea ve befor e the y arriv e. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t contain an
account of what Henr y’s home looks lik e. The setting is established as the house of Henr y’s mother , and the dialogue focuses
solely on her wish that Henr y should depar t befor e her friends arriv e. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mention how

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of John Ashber y’s poems. As used in this
context, “interpr et” would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashber y’s poems ha ve many unusual f eatur es,
that it’ s diﬃcult t o tell what exactly the poems’ subject matter is, and that scholars str ongly disagr ee about the poems. This
context conv eys the idea that it’ s diﬃcult t o interpr et Ashber y’s poems. 
Choice A is incorr ect because “ delegate ” means t o assign someone as a r epresentativ e of another person or t o entrust something
to someone else, neither of which would mak e sense in context. The text is focused only on the diﬃculty that r eaders ha ve
interpr eting Ashber y’s poems due t o their many unusual f eatur es; it doesn ’t suggest anything about the poems being diﬃcult t o
delegate. Choice B is incorr ect because describing Ashber y’s poems as diﬃcult t o “compose, ” or put t ogether or pr oduce, would
mak e sense only if the text wer e about Ashber y’s experience of writing the poems. It could be true that it was diﬃcult for Ashber y
to compose his poems, but the text doesn ’t addr ess this; it instead discusses how r eaders interpr et and engage with the poems.
Choice D is incorr ect because describing Ashber y’s poems as being diﬃcult t o “renounce, ” or giv e up or r efuse, wouldn ’t mak e
sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that f eatur es of Ashber y’s poems ar e odd or unclear and ha ve caused heated

Choice C is the best answer . "Protect" means " preser ve" or "k eep saf e from." By ensuring that the wilderness ar eas along the
Appalachian Trail can ’t be sold or de veloped, the National Trails System Act pr otects them.
Choice A is incorr ect. "Borr ow" means "t o tak e something with intent t o return it. " The text doesn ’t say anything about taking and

Nothing in the passage suggests that Congr ess wants t o "postpone " the wilderness ar eas (and that doesn ’t mak e sense anywa y—

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst
sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be “k eenly sensitiv e to” scenes that ser ve as a “ﬁtting back ground” for her f eelings—
that is, she ’s very awar e of when a setting seems t o reﬂect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstr ates
this awar eness: Lily views the landscape she ’s in as a lar ge-scale r eﬂection of her curr ent mood, identifying with elements such as
its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is t o illustr ate an idea intr oduced in the pr evious sentence.
Choice A is incorr ect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in v ery gener al terms, r eferring t o its calmness,
breadth, and long str etches of land. It’ s the next sentence that adds speciﬁc details about colors, light, and v arious tr ees nearb y.
Choice B is incorr ect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conﬂict. In fact, the
sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape r eﬂects her own f eeling of calmness. Choice C is incorr ect because the only
asser tion in the underlined sentence is that Lily f eels that br oad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, r eﬂect her curr ent
mood, and that asser tion isn ’t expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes speciﬁc details of the scene

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o the author ’s conclusion
in Text 1 based on the information pr ovided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of ﬂamingo f eathers comes fr om
pigments carried b y the brine shrimp ﬂamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a ﬂamingo that is
pinker than another ﬂamingo must ha ve eaten mor e shrimp. Howe ver, accor ding t o Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that
ﬂamingos can also aff ect how pink the y look thr ough gr ooming, when the y mo ve ingested pigments fr om a gland near the tail t o
their f eathers. This indicates that not all the pigments a vailable fr om the shrimp a ﬂamingo has eaten aut omatically end up
coloring the ﬂamingo ’s feathers; some ma y or ma y not be applied later . Since gr ooming is also a fact or, the ecologist (Amat) in
Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o the conclusion in Text 1 that pink er ﬂamingos ha ve eaten mor e shrimp b y pointing out that the
amount of shrimp eaten isn ’t the only thing that inﬂuences ﬂamingos’ coloring.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that ﬂamingos can mo ve pigments t o their f eathers fr om
a gland near their tail, ther e is no indication that their tail f eathers ar e pink er than their other f eathers. Mor eover, the point that tail
feathers ar e pink er than other f eathers wouldn ’t logically addr ess the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a
ﬂamingo ’s coloring. Choice B is incorr ect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that ﬂamingos’ f eathers do
sometimes look pink er and giv es no indication that this change in color is par ticularly subtle. Mor eover, the point that most
obser vers wouldn ’t notice a change wouldn ’t logically addr ess the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a
ﬂamingo ’s coloring. Choice D is incorr ect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would ar gue about ﬂamingos’
shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that ﬂamingos ma y mak e themselv es look pink er
during mating season, this is addr essed in terms of gr ooming habits; apar t from r eferring t o food as a sour ce of pigments, Text 2

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst two
sentences establish that bir ds of some species don ’t raise their own y oung; instead, the y lay their eggs in the nests of bir ds of
other species. The underlined sentence then states that f emale cuckoo bir ds engage in this beha vior, having been obser ved
speciﬁcally la ying their eggs in other nests while the other bir ds ar e out ﬁnding food. Accor ding t o the text, the cuckoo chicks ar e
then r aised b y the other bir ds. Thus, the underlined sentence pr ovides a par ticular detail about how f emale cuckoos carr y out the
beha vior of la ying eggs for other bir ds to raise.
Choice A is incorr ect. Rather than mentioning a physical f eatur e of f emale cuckoos, the underlined sentence intr oduces a speciﬁc
beha vior of f emale cuckoos: la ying eggs in the nests of bir ds of other species when the other bir ds ar e awa y. The only r eference t o
physical f eatur es is the last sentence ’s gener al mention of cuckoo chicks looking diff erent fr om chicks of other species. Choice B
is incorr ect because the underlined sentence r efers t o the nests of bir ds other than cuckoos and doesn ’t describe how any nests
look, cuckoo or other wise. Instead, the sentence addr esses how f emale cuckoos use other bir ds’ nests. Choice D is incorr ect
because the underlined sentence describes only f emale cuckoo beha vior (la ying eggs in the nests of bir ds of other species when
the other bir ds ar e awa y); it’ s the last sentence of the text that addr esses the other bir ds’ reaction, indicating that those bir ds
usually r aise the cuckoo chicks once the y’ve hatched.

effects extend is unclear . Hypothesizing that diff erences in land use lead t o diff erences in carbon and nitr ogen le vels that ar e not
restricted t o the t opsoil la yer (0–30 cm deep), Chukwuebuka Okolo and colleagues sampled soils acr oss multiple land-use types
(e.g., gr azing land, cr opland, for est) within each of se veral Ethiopian locations. They found, though, that acr oss land-use types,
carbon and nitr ogen decr eased t o compar ably low le vels be yond depths of 30 cm.

ID: f61c22f3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the o verall structur e of the text. The text begins b y explaining
that human activities inﬂuence carbon and nitr ogen le vels in soil, but how deeply these eff ects ar e seen in the soil r emains an
unresolv ed question. Next, the text summariz es Okolo and colleagues’ hypothesis r egar ding this question—which is that the
different eff ects on carbon and nitr ogen le vels associated with diff erent types of land use would also be obser ved below the
topsoil la yer—and then brieﬂy explains the methods the y used t o test this hypothesis. Finally , the text states that the r esear chers
found that at depths below the t opsoil la yer, carbon and nitr ogen decr eased t o similarly low le vels acr oss all land-use types, a
ﬁnding that conﬂicts with the team ’s hypothesis pr esented earlier in the text. Thus, the text intr oduces an unr esolv ed scientiﬁc
question, pr esents a r esear ch team ’s hypothesis per taining t o that question, and then describes an obser vation that the team
made that conﬂicted with their hypothesis.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text intr oduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities inﬂuence carbon and nitr ogen
levels in the soil) that isn ’t fully underst ood b y scientists and explains a r esear ch team ’s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the
text doesn ’t describe how the team r eﬁned their hypothesis when a r esear ch ﬁnding contr adicted it. Choice C is incorr ect because
the text doesn ’t discuss a pr ocess at all; r ather , it poses an unsolv ed scientiﬁc question and pr esents a hypothesis that Okolo and
colleagues tested t o answer that question. Mor eover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn ’t mention any competing
hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo ’s team was able t o determine which hypothesis was corr ect. Choice D is incorr ect
because the text doesn ’t begin b y presenting a hypothesis that is under scientiﬁc debate; r ather , it pr esents a question that
scientists ha ve been unable t o answer and then intr oduces a hypothesis formulated b y Okolo and colleagues. While the text does
explain how Okolo ’s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on t o sa y that their data conﬂicted with their hypothesis, not that
the data v alidated, or suppor ted, their hypothesis.

ID: 54804e10  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of ar chitectur al inﬂuences among
Mesoamerican cities. In this context, “ commonalities with ” means similarities t o or shar ed attributes with. The text indicates that a
recently disco vered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and
other e vidence of Teotihuacán inﬂuence, which suggests that the citadel possesses f eatur es that r esemble ar chitectur al featur es
found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán ar chitectur e.
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “r eﬁnements of, ” or
impr ovements on, Teotihuacán ar chitectur e. Although the text suggests that the ar chitectur e of Teotihuacán inﬂuenced the
architectur e of the Tikal citadel, and although it’ s possible that later ar chitectur al designs could mak e impr ovements on earlier
designs, the text doesn ’t discuss whether , in imitating Teotihuacán ar chitectur e, the Tikal citadel’ s builders impr oved on it. Choice
B is incorr ect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing “ precursors of ” Teotihuacán ar chitectur e—or f eatur es that
preceded and for eshadowed those of Teotihuacán ar chitectur e—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the
relationship between the ar chitectur e found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the disco very of similarities between
the Tikal citadel and the ar chitectur e of Teotihuacán, including a r eplica of a temple in Teotihuacán, pr ovides e vidence of outside
inﬂuences on Tikal ar chitectur e. If the Tikal citadel was inﬂuenced b y Teotihuacán ar chitectur e, then the Teotihuacán ar chitectur e
must pr edate the citadel, not the other wa y around. In this context, ther efore, it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that the Tikal citadel
shows pr ecursors of Teotihuacán ar chitectur e. Choice D is incorr ect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates
the inﬂuence of Teotihuacán ar chitectur e, which implies that the mak ers of the Tikal citadel lik ely admir ed aspects of Teotihuacán
architectur e enough t o imitate it. Thus, ther e’s no r eason t o think that the Tikal citadel pr ovides e vidence of the Tikal people ’s
“animosities t owar d,” or f eelings of str ong dislik e or hostility t owar d, Teotihuacán ar chitectur e.

A. Protectiv e
B. Restrictiv e
C. Affectionate
D. Suspicious
ID: 6cf906f c Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, " sheltering" most nearly means pr otectiv e. In the text, the speak er
describes a painting f eaturing a f emale ﬁgur e. The speak er ultimately conf esses t o falling in lo ve with the woman in the painting,
who has " stole[n] awa y" the speak er’s hear t, but ﬁrst the speak er describes elements of the painting’ s setting. These include sterile
soil, barr en ﬁelds with " no ray / Of hope in a blade of gr een"—a description that conv eys a mood of melancholy and forlornness,
possibly r eﬂecting the speak er’s own sadness at falling in lo ve with an image that can ’t return the speak er’s love. The text
continues b y stating that ther e’s no " sheltering r oof" in the painting, e ven though the " skies ar e hea vy and gr ay," showing signs of
an impending st orm. Gener ally, a roof’s intended purpose is t o provide pr otection fr om the elements, and in this context, a r oof
would off er shelter and pr otection fr om the gathering st orm.
Choice B is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that a r oof would be r estrictiv e—that is, that it would limit or r estrain
something in some wa y. Although a r oof would pr ovide some co ver from st ormy winds and r ain, it wouldn ’t limit the wind and r ain,
only deﬂect them. Choice C is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that if a " sheltering r oof" wer e present in the
painting, it would be aff ectionate, or lo ving and tender . In the text, the immediate context in which the wor d "sheltering" appears
refers t o the absence of a r oof that would pr ovide pr otection fr om the oncoming st orm depicted in the painting, not t o the idea that
such a shelter would be lo ving and tender if it wer e present. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context, suspicious would mean
questionable or dubious, and ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that if any r oofs wer e present in the painting, the y would be
questionable or cause any suspicion.

A. Denying
B. Entering
C. Carr ying
D. Hearing
ID: 4480fae9  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “r eceiving” most nearly means hearing, or per ceiving sound. The text
describes Mr . Spring F ragrance as he r eads a newspaper , focusing on his e yes and ears. While his e yes look at the newspaper , he
is unwillingly distr acted b y wor ds coming thr ough a nearb y open window (that is, “his ears could not help r eceiving the wor ds”).
The wor ds ar e being per ceived speciﬁcally b y his ears and not his e yes, and ears ar e the or gans of sense with which one hears, so
therefore Mr . Spring F ragrance is hearing the wor ds thr ough the open window .
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e is no indication in the text that Mr . Spring F ragrance is denying, or r efusing the truth of, the
words coming t o him thr ough the window . He is mer ely distr acted b y them. Choice B is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense
to sa y that Mr . Spring F ragrance ’s ears couldn ’t help entering, or coming int o, the wor ds coming t o him thr ough the window .
Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr . Spring F ragrance hears the wor ds, the y enter his ears, but his
ears don ’t enter the wor ds. Choice C is incorr ect because it doesn ’t mak e sense in this context t o think of Mr . Spring F ragrance as
carrying the wor ds coming t o him thr ough the window , even though the wor d “carry” can ha ve a number of diff erent meanings
depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not suppor ting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of climate activity in Ear th’s distant past. In
this context, t o “simulate ” most nearly means t o represent a natur al pr ocess using computer models. Accor ding t o the text,
understanding Ear th’s early climate is diﬃcult because we cannot mak e dir ect obser vations of the distant past. Instead, scientists
must cr eate computer models that appr oximate early climate conditions, based on the physical e vidence that those conditions left
behind on Ear th’s sur face. This context suppor ts the idea that computer models simulate Ear th’s climate in the distant past.
Choice A is incorr ect because scientists use existing physical e vidence as a basis for de veloping computer models that describe
what Ear th’s actual past climate might ha ve been lik e. The models ar e not being used t o “inv ent,” or imagine, a completely ﬁctional
climate. Choice C is incorr ect because the computer models ar e being used in an attempt t o describe as accur ately as possible
what Ear th’s past climate might ha ve been lik e. They are not attempting t o “exagger ate,” or dist ort, those f eatur es. Choice D is

D. It establishes that criticism of the CEP was limited t o a f ew individuals in the Southern Christian Leadership Conf erence.
ID: 2e744883  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. The
ﬁrst sentence of the text states that the CEP had a positiv e impact on the Civil Rights Mo vement in the 1960s. The next sentence
explains that the CEP or ganiz ed workshops for attendees, who later used the knowledge the y gained t o lead civil rights initiativ es.
And the underlined por tion indicates the number of activists—mor e than 7,000—who par ticipated in the workshops. Thus, the
underlined por tion pr ovides a number that underscor es the extent of the CEP’ s impact on the Civil Rights Mo vement in the 1960s.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the sentence that contains the underlined por tion mentions some CEP workshop t opics, the
underlined por tion itself addr esses the number of par ticipants in the CEP workshops, not the number of t opics co vered. Choice C
is incorr ect. Although the underlined por tion r efers t o attendees of the CEP workshops, nothing in the underlined por tion or the
text as a whole addr esses the Southern Christian Leadership Conf erence ’s philosophy or the attendees’ opinions ther eof. Choice D
is incorr ect because neither the underlined por tion nor the text as a whole mentions any criticism of the CEP b y members of the

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, " suppor ted" most nearly means held up or sustained physically . The
sentence describes the physical structur e of the P anhandle bridge, stating it was " suppor ted b y massiv e sandst one pillars. " This
clearly r efers t o the structur al relationship between the bridge and its pillars—the pillars physically hold up the bridge and k eep it
standing. The text fur ther emphasiz es the physical natur e of this suppor t by describing the pillars as " stalwar t" (str ong and stur dy)
and noting the y’ve been per forming this function for ﬁfty y ears.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although in some contexts " suppor ted" can mean " encour aged, " the sandst one pillars and bridge described
in the text ar e all inanimate objects that can ’t provide or r eceiv e encour agement. The text clearly describes a structur al
relationship between the elements of the bridge, not an emotional one. Choice C is incorr ect. Although in some contexts
"suppor ted" has a meaning similar t o "impr oved on, " the text doesn ’t suggest that the sandst one pillars ha ve enhanced or made
the bridge better; r ather , they simply pr ovide the necessar y physical foundation t o keep the bridge standing. Thus, the sentence
describes the structur al elements of the bridge, not impr ovements made t o it. Choice D is incorr ect. Although in some contexts
"suppor ted" can mean " defended, " the text doesn ’t present a situation in which the sandst one pillars ar e def ending the bridge fr om

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it char acteriz es how Maddux would most lik ely respond t o the conclusion Sharif r eached
after her r esear ch. Text 1 describes Sharif ’s study of the beneﬁts of fr ee time, sa ying that the r epor ted sense of satisfaction

 Howe ver, in Text 2 Maddux sa ys that ther e is no objectiv e deﬁnition of what constitutes pr oductiv e beha vior, giving the example
that r eading a book might be consider ed pr oductiv e by some but unpr oductiv e by others. It can be inf erred that Maddux would
also asser t that whether watching TV or pla ying games is pr oductiv e or unpr oductiv e is a matter of subjectiv e judgment. Thus,
Maddux would most lik ely caution against making an o verly br oad assumption, as ther e is no clear consensus in distinguishing

Choice A is incorr ect because Maddux asser ts that individuals ha ve unique needs for lif e satisfaction: some ma y want t o spend

satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unpr oductiv ely. Choice D is incorr ect because Maddux holds the opinion that
whether an activity is pr oductiv e or unpr oductiv e is subjectiv e and depends on the individual; ther efore, he would most lik ely claim

Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and pr ecisely completes the text’ s discussion of the Southern P aciﬁc
Railr oad. As used in this context, " dominance " means the state of being mor e successful than others. The text states that the
Southern P aciﬁc Railr oad alr eady contr olled 85% of California ’s railwa ys in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883
was the ﬁrst tr anscontinental r ail line acr oss the southern United States. Ther efore, the Southern P aciﬁc Railr oad would be mor e
successful than other r ailroads in the ar ea, and the construction of the Sunset Route would fur ther solidify its dominance in r ail
access t o California ’s coast.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must ha ve requir ed some cr eativity , or use of imagination, the
word "creativity " would not also encompass the fact that the Southern P aciﬁc Railr oad alr eady contr olled 85% of California ’s
railwa ys. The text is mor e focused on the r ailroad’s contr ol of the ﬁeld and o verall success r ather than its imaginativ e thought
processes. Choice C is incorr ect because if the Southern P aciﬁc Railr oad contr olled the majority of California ’s railwa ys, it would
not mak e sense t o refer to its "insigniﬁcance, " or the state of being unimpor tant. Rather , the opposite would be true. Choice D is
incorr ect because in context it would not mak e sense t o refer to the Southern P aciﬁc Railr oad’s "neutr ality," or absence of str ong
opinion on a matter , since no opinions ar e mentioned. Nor would " neutr ality" in the sense of impar tiality in a conﬂict be a logical or
precise choice since no conﬂict is explicitly described. Ther e might be an implied conﬂict between the Southern P aciﬁc Railr oad
and other r ailroads doing business in California, but that is not a conﬂict in which the Southern P aciﬁc Railr oad would tak e an

C. Come t o a decision about
D. Have an opinion on
ID: ab1bd603  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, " consider " most nearly means t o tak e int o account and follow . The text
explains that Marija ’s job was t o mak e sur e that her sister ’s wedding pr oceeded in cer tain wa ys ("in due form ") and that she loudly
directed e veryone’s actions all da y. The text then indicates that Marija was so focused on ensuring that others " conformed t o the
proprieties"—that is, that the y beha ved in appr opriate wa ys—that she failed t o "consider them herself "; that is, she didn ’t tak e
standar ds of appr opriate beha vior int o account and follow them in her own actions.
Choice B is incorr ect. In some contexts, " consider " can mean t o think about something in a positiv e wa y—which can inv olve
admir ation—but the text doesn ’t suggest that Marija was so busy imposing " proprieties" (standar ds of appr opriate beha vior) on
others that she didn ’t admir e and pr aise them herself. The context suggests it’ s mor e likely that Marija did speak positiv ely of " due
form " and "the best home tr aditions" while ensuring others beha ved in cer tain wa ys. Choice C is incorr ect. In some contexts,
"consider " can mean t o come t o a decision, but the text doesn ’t suggest that Marija wasn ’t able t o mak e a decision for herself
about the " proprieties" (standar ds of appr opriate beha vior) she ensur ed e veryone else conformed t o. Rather , the context conv eys
that Marija knew v ery clearly which beha viors others should follow as " due form " and "the best home tr aditions. " Choice D is
incorr ect. In some contexts, " consider " can mean t o ha ve an opinion, but the text doesn ’t suggest that Marija wasn ’t able t o ha ve
an opinion on the " proprieties" (standar ds of appr opriate beha vior) she was ensuring others conformed t o. Rather , the context
conv eys that Marija had str ong f eelings about which beha viors wer e "due form " and "the best home tr aditions. "

Mathematician Claude Shannon is widely r egar ded as a foundational ﬁgur e in information theor y. His most impor tant paper , “A
Mathematical Theor y of Communication, ” published in 1948 when he was emplo yed at Bell Labs, utiliz ed a concept called a
“binar y digit” (shor tened t o “bit”) t o measur e the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest r ate at which
information could be tr ansmitted while still being r eliably decipher able. Rober t Gallagher , one of Shannon ’s colleagues, said that
the bit was “[Shannon ’s] disco very, and fr om it the whole communications r evolution has sprung. ”
Which choice best describes the o verall structur e of the text?
A. It presents a theor etical concept, illustr ates how the name of the concept has changed, and shows how the name has enter ed
common usage.
B. It intr oduces a r espected r esear cher , describes an aspect of his work, and suggests why the work is hist orically signiﬁcant.
C. It names the company wher e an impor tant mathematician work ed, details the mathematician ’s car eer at the company , and
provides an example of the r ecognition he r eceiv ed ther e.
D. It mentions a paper , offers a summar y of the paper ’s ﬁndings, and pr esents a r esear cher ’s commentar y on the paper .
ID: b4887dae  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The text star ts with a gener al statement that intr oduces Shannon, then describes a speciﬁc
contribution fr om one of his papers, then pr ovides a quote that illustr ates just how impor tant this contribution was.
Choice A is incorr ect. This isn ’t the o verall structur e. The text only mentions v ery brieﬂy , in par entheses, that “binar y digit” was
shor tened t o “bit. ” It doesn ’t go int o detail about this name change, and it doesn ’t discuss any “ common usage ” of the name at all.
Choice C is incorr ect. This isn ’t the o verall structur e. Shannon ’s emplo yment at Bell Labs is only mentioned once, v ery brieﬂy: the
text ne ver goes int o detail about his car eer ther e, and it ne ver mentions any r ecognition he r eceiv ed ther e. Choice D is incorr ect.
This is t oo narr ow. Overall, the text is about Shannon ’s impor tance in his ﬁeld, not just this one paper of his.

Today the star chy r oot cassa va is found in many dishes acr oss W est Africa, but its rise t o popularity was slow . Portuguese tr aders
brought cassa va from Br azil t o the W est African coast in the 1500s. But at this time, people living in the capitals fur ther inland had
little contact with coastal communities. Thus, cassa va remained r elativ ely unknown t o most of the r egion ’s inhabitants until the
1800s.
 
Text 2
Cassa va’s slow adoption int o the diet of W est Africans is mainly due t o the natur e of the cr op itself. If not cook ed pr operly ,
cassa va can be t oxic. K nowledge of how t o properly pr epar e cassa va needed t o spr ead befor e the food could gr ow in popularity .
The arriv al of formerly ensla ved people fr om Br azil in the 1800s, who br ought their knowledge of cassa va and its pr epar ation with
them, thus dir ectly fueled the spr ead of this cr op.
Based on the texts, the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 would most lik ely agr ee with which statement?
A. Cassa va did not become a signiﬁcant cr op in W est Africa until long after it was ﬁrst intr oduced.
B. Several of the most commonly gr own cr ops in W est Africa ar e originally fr om Br azil.
C. The climate of the W est African coast in the 1500s pr evented cassa va’s spr ead in the r egion. 
D. The most commonly used methods t o cook cassa va today date t o the 1500s.
ID: c68ceeff  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . Text 1 states that cassa va’s “rise t o popularity was slow” in W est Africa. Text 2 also describes
cassa va’s “slow adoption int o the diet of W est Africans. ” While the two texts identify diff erent causes for this slow adoption, both
agree that cassa va took a long time t o catch on.
Choice B is incorr ect. This isn ’t something that either text claims. Cassa va is the only cr op discussed in the passages, so we ha ve
no basis t o draw conclusions about what the authors might sa y about “ several” cr ops. Choice C is incorr ect. This isn ’t something
that either text claims. Neither text mentions the “ climate of the W est African coast, ” so we ha ve no e vidence that either author
would agr ee with this. Choice D is incorr ect. This isn ’t something that either text claims. The 1500s wer e when cassa va was
brought t o West Africa, but neither text describes how cassa va is cook ed, nor do the y mak e any claims about when cooking

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A. To contr ast the conditions in the A tacama Deser t with those on Mars
B. To explain why many lif e-forms cannot sur vive in the A tacama Deser t
C. To indicate why astr obiologists choose t o conduct r esear ch in the A tacama Deser t
D. To describe cer tain limitations t o conducting scientiﬁc study in the A tacama Deser t
ID: cf9a00e0  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole.
The ﬁrst sentence describes a unique location on Ear th, the A tacama Deser t. The next sentence, which is the underlined sentence,
states that the r eason why astr obiologists study lif e, or its r emains, in this unique location is that A tacama is a harsh envir onment
that closely r esembles the extr eme envir onment of Mars. The r emainder of the text explains that the r esear chers hope their work
in Atacama will suppor t inquir y into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined por tion functions mainly t o indicate why astr obiologists
choose t o conduct r esear ch in the A tacama Deser t.
Choice A is incorr ect because t o contr ast two things means t o show the diff erences between them, and the phr ase " closely
mirrors" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extr eme envir onment in the A tacama Deser t is similar t o, not diff erent fr om,
that on Mars. This similarity is why , accor ding t o the underlined sentence, astr obiologists conduct r esear ch in A tacama. Choice B
is incorr ect because the underlined sentence doesn ’t addr ess forms of lif e that ar e unable t o sur vive the harsh envir onment of the
Atacama Deser t. Instead, the underlined sentence explains why astr obiologists study lif e, or its r emains, in this envir onment.
Choice D is incorr ect because the underlined sentence doesn ’t suggest that the scientiﬁc r esear ch in the A tacama Deser t is
limited in any wa y; instead, the sentence explains that the similarity between the envir onments of A tacama and Mars is the r eason
why astr obiologists sear ch for lif e, or its r emains, in A tacama.

As used in the text, what does the wor d “determine ” most nearly mean?
A. Conclude
B. Dictate
C. Evaluate
D. Select
ID: 9b22bf7b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text " determine " most nearly means " dictate. " The text describes the
relationship between the main char acter and those who exhibit, pr aise, and pur chase his ar twork. The text states that the main
char acter is often ask ed to change his ar t or himself based on outside inﬂuences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main
char acter admits that those who suppor t his work often shape it based on their demands, it follows that those outside inﬂuences
dictate, or guide or dominate, the dir ection his work tak es.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that outside inﬂuences " conclude, " or end, the main char acter ’s work. The
text states that many suppor ters of the main char acter ’s art "demand its pr oliferation, " not its conclusion. Choice C is incorr ect
because the text doesn ’t suggest that outside inﬂuences ar e "evaluating, " or judging the main char acter ’s work. Accor ding t o the
text, the main char acter ’s art has alr eady achie ved gr eat commer cial success, with many people exhibiting, pur chasing, and
praising his work. Thus, outsiders ha ve alr eady suppor ted the main char acter ’s work and ar e not questioning or e valuating its
success or wor th. They are instead inﬂuencing its initial dir ection. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that
outside inﬂuences " select, " or choose the main char acter ’s work. Accor ding t o the text, the main char acter ’s art has alr eady
achie ved gr eat commer cial success, with many people exhibiting, pur chasing, and pr aising his work. Thus, outsiders ha ve alr eady

ID: daaed806  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the r esear ch that Lopes-F erreira and her
colleagues ar e conducting on the stingr ay species Potamotr ygon r ex. As used in this context, “ a substantial” eff ect means an
effect that is sizable or notewor thy. The text indicates that the r esear chers ar e seeking t o determine whether ther e are
“consider able v ariations” in the potency of stingr ay venom that ar e associated with v ariation in the stingr ays’ age and sex. This
context suggests that the r esear chers want t o ﬁnd out whether stingr ay age and sex ha ve a substantial eff ect on v enom t oxicity .
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text that suggests that the r esear chers ha ve been studying whether the
stingr ays’ age and sex ha ve “a disconcer ting,” or an unsettling and disturbing, eff ect on the stingr ays’ v enom. The text indicates
that the r esear chers wish t o determine if stingr ay age and sex cause lar ge variations in the t oxicity of stingr ay venom, not if the
effect of age and sex is disconcer ting. Choice B is incorr ect because the text indicates that r esear chers want t o ﬁnd out whether
differences in stingr ay age and sex pr oduce diff erences in stingr ay venom, not that the r esear chers want t o ﬁnd out whether age
and sex ha ve “an acceptable, ” or a satisfact ory, effect on v enom. The text mak es no mention of what would mak e an eff ect on
venom t oxicity acceptable and giv es no indication that the r esear chers ar e inter ested in that question. Choice C is incorr ect
because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context for the r esear chers t o be looking for “ an imper ceptible, ” or an unnoticeable, eff ect of
age and sex on stingr ay venom. The text sa ys that the r esear chers ar e trying t o determine if ther e are “consider able v ariations” in
venom t oxicity link ed to age and sex, not that the r esear chers ar e trying t o ﬁnd eff ects that the y can ’t per ceive.

D. It identiﬁes a r esult that confused the team.
ID: d2a90d4f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined phr ase functions in the text as a whole. The
text states that the wax pr oduced b y Liu and colleagues’ r eact or can be turned int o a sur factant. The underlined phr ase, which is
set off with par entheses, then pr ovides a deﬁnition for the term " surfactant, " explaining that it’ s a chemical compound that can be
used as a deter gent. Thus, the underlined por tion of the text functions t o clarify the meaning of a scientiﬁc term.
Choice B is incorr ect. Though the text as a whole focuses br oadly on an envir onmental concern, the underlined phr ase does not; it
simply indicates what a sur factant is. Choice C is incorr ect. Though the text as a whole focuses on a scientiﬁc disco very (Liu and
colleagues’ solution t o the pr oblem of plastic r ecycling), the underlined phr ase does not explain its signiﬁcance; it simply deﬁnes a
scientiﬁc term used in the discussion. Choice D is incorr ect. Though the text as a whole includes discussion of the r esult found b y
Liu and colleagues, the underlined phr ase does not discuss it; it simply deﬁnes a scientiﬁc term used in the discussion.
Additionally , at no point in the text is it mentioned that the team was confused.

ID: 84f9b577  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, " collects" most nearly means gathers or accumulates. In the text, Gogol
"collects" (or gathers) r ocks and digs in the sand while str olling the beach with his father . Thus, " gathers" is the best answer .
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, "incr eases" would mean expands or inﬂates, which is not something a child could

Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, " mak es" would suggest that Gogol is cr eating or manufacturing r ocks, which doesn ’t
mak e sense. Rather , the text indicates that Gogol " collects" or gathers r ocks while str olling the beach with his father . Choice C is
incorr ect because in this context, "ignor es" would mean disr egar ds or a voids, but in the text Gogol " collects r ocks, " which indicates

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the pr eser vation effor ts under taken b y
Erika Karuzas and the Conf eder ated Salish and K ootenai Tribes of Montana. In this context, " promote " means pla y a par t in the
success or gr owth of something or someone. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Conf eder ated Salish and K ootenai Tribes

motiv ated b y the fact that such a tr ail would r eceiv e protections fr om the US go vernment that the sites wouldn ’t other wise r eceiv e.
Thus, such a decision would pr omote the pr eser vation effor ts.
Choice A is incorr ect because "inspir e" means motiv ate or inﬂuence, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text establishes
that Karuzas and the Conf eder ated Salish and K ootenai Tribes of Montana work t o preser ve cultur ally signiﬁcant sites and that
their decision t o create a new national tr ail occurr ed as a r esult of a desir e to add pr otections t o the sites that the y wouldn ’t

Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst
sentence pr esents the implications of V eeraragha van’s team ’s study: sunshine exposur e during work hours can cause o verly
optimistic beha vior. The underlined sentence then describes the data the team consulted and how the y wer e used (comparing

Text 1
Fossils of the hominin Australopithecus africanus  have been found in the Sterkfontein Ca ves of South Africa, but assigning an age
to the fossils is challenging because of the unr eliability of dating methods in this context.  The geology of Sterkfontein has caused
soil la yers fr om diff erent periods t o mix, impeding str atigr aphic dating, and dates cannot be r eliably imputed fr om those of nearb y
animal bones since the bones ma y have been r elocated b y ﬂooding.
Text 2
Archaeologists used new cosmogenic nuclide dating techniques t o reevaluate the ages of A. africanus  fossils found in the
Sterkfontein Ca ves. This technique inv olves analyzing the cosmogenic nucleotides in the br eccia—the matrix of r ock fr agments
immediately surr ounding the fossils. The r esear chers asser t that this appr oach a voids the potential for misdating associated with
assigning ages based on Sterkfontein ’s soil la yers or animal bones.
Based on the texts, how would the r esear chers in Text 2 most lik ely respond t o the underlined por tion in Text 1?
A. They would emphasiz e the fact that the A. africanus  fossils found in the Sterkfontein Ca ves ma y have been corrupted in some
way over the y ears.
B. They would contend that if analyses of surr ounding la yers and bones in the Sterkfontein Ca ves wer e combined, then the dating
of the fossils ther e would be mor e accur ate. 
C. They would ar gue that their techniques ar e better suited than other methods t o the unique challenges posed b y the
Sterkfontein Ca ves.
D. They would claim that cosmogenic nuclide dating is r eliable in the context of the Sterkfontein Ca ves because it is applied t o
the fossils dir ectly .
ID: f3c45b4f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . Text 2 states that the r esear chers used cosmogenic nuclide dating t o "avoid the potential for
misdating" caused b y the geology of Sterkfontein, which Text 1 describes as " challenging" and unr eliable.
Choice A is incorr ect. Neither text suggests that the A. africanus  fossils ha ve been " corrupted, " but only that tr aditional dating
methods ar e diﬃcult in Sterkfontein because of ﬂoods and soil mixing wher e the fossils wer e found. Nothing is implied t o ha ve
compr omised the fossils themselv es. Choice B is incorr ect. This choice misr eads Text 2. Text 2 agr ees that str atigr aphy and other
methods ar e prone t o err or in the context of Sterkfontein: ther e’s a " potential for misdating" when e valuating age based on soil
layers and bones. Choice D is incorr ect. Text 2 does not state that cosmogenic nuclide dating is applied t o the fossils dir ectly but
rather t o the br eccia that surr ounds them.

these animals died out, cucurbits faced extinction in turn, ha ving lost their means of seed dispersal. Ar ound this time, howe ver, the
ancest ors of Indigenous peoples in Nor th America began r aising cucurbits as cr ops, thus ______  the plants’ sur vival.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. verifying
B. multiplying
C. comfor ting
D. ensuring
ID: bdab32f c Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of cucurbits. In this context, “ ensuring”
means guar anteeing, or making sur e of, the cucurbits’ sur vival. The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because
their means of seed dispersal disappear ed, but the ancest ors of Indigenous peoples in Nor th America began farming cucurbits
around that same time, so the cr ops wer e no longer thr eatened. Ther efore, the context suppor ts the idea that the ancest ors of
Indigenous peoples in Nor th America helped with ensuring the cucurbits’ sur vival.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context v erifying means making sur e that something is accur ate. In the text, the ancest ors of
Indigenous peoples in Nor th America wer e ensuring the sur vival, not the accur acy of, the cucurbits. Choice B is incorr ect. Although
the cucurbit cr ops themselv es wer e multiplying, or gr owing in number , as a r esult of the work of the ancest ors of Indigenous
peoples in Nor th America, it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o sa y that the sur vival of the plants was multiplying. Choice C is
incorr ect because accor ding t o the text, in r aising cucurbits as cr ops, the ancest ors of Indigenous peoples in Nor th America wer e
attempting t o help the plants gr ow and sur vive; the y wer en’t attempting t o comfor t, or fr ee the plants fr om pain.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. a collabor ation
B. an accessor y
C. a contr adiction
D. an analogy
ID: e8c26398  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The text after the semicolon tells us that Hu "identif[ied] br oad similarities between two seemingly
different phenomena, " comparing ants with light par ticles. Since an analogy seeks similarities between seemingly unr elated
phenomena, this ﬁts the context per fectly .
Choice A is incorr ect. " A collabor ation " refers t o "an act of working with others, " but what comes after the semicolon doesn ’t
describe collabor ation with other r esear chers. Instead, it shows a comparison between two diff erent (but ultimately similar)
scientiﬁc phenomena. Choice B is incorr ect. " An accessor y" can r efer to "something added t o incr ease attr activ eness or
usefulness. " No accessories ar e described in this text. Choice C is incorr ect. " A contr adiction " means " a set of ideas or things that
are opposed t o or inconsistent with each other ." The text describes how Hu used the similarity between ant and light par ticle
movement t o de velop his method, so a wor d that r efers t o diff erence would not mak e sense her e.

A. inhibited b y
B. contingent on
C. obligated t o
D. reser ved for
ID: 4830ab87  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of visual balance in phot ography . In this
context, " contingent on " means conditional upon, or determined b y. The text indicates that diff erent wa ys of balancing elements in
a phot ograph conv ey diff erent ideas t o viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends t o emphasiz e similarity among
elements, wher eas asymmetr y tends t o emphasiz e diff erence). Thus, ther e is a str ong connection between what a phot ograph
conv eys and how its elements ar e balanced. Ther efore, what a phot o conv eys is contingent on how it is balanced.
Choice A is incorr ect. In this context, "inhibited b y" most nearly means hinder ed or undermined b y. The text indicates that diff erent
ways of balancing elements in a phot ograph conv ey diff erent ideas t o viewers, ther eby indicating a r elationship between image
balance and what is conv eyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a phot ographer choosing asymmetrical balance e ven
while intending t o conv ey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), ther e is nothing t o indicate that messages gener ally
are inhibited b y balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a t ool phot ographers can use t o craft their messages. Choice C
is incorr ect. In this context, " obligated t o" means duty bound t owar d or answer able t o. In context, it would not mak e sense t o
asser t that a phot ograph’s message is obligated t o how that phot ograph is balanced. Choice D is incorr ect. In this context,
"reser ved for " most nearly means solely a vailable t o someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not
suppor t the claim that a phot ograph’s message is r eser ved for how that phot ograph is balanced.

The following text is adapted fr om Z ora Neale Hurst on’s 1921 shor t story “John Redding Goes t o Sea. ” John is a child who liv es in
a town in the woods.
Perhaps ten-y ear-old John was puzzling t o the folk ther e in the Florida woods for he was an imaginativ e child and fond of da y-
dreams. The St. John Riv er ﬂowed a scar ce thr ee hundr ed feet fr om his back door . On its banks at this point gr ow numer ous

Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world and [he] wanted t o follow them.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A. It provides an extended description of a location that John lik es to visit.
B. It reveals that some r esidents of John ’s town ar e confused b y his beha vior.
C. It illustr ates the uniqueness of John ’s imagination compar ed to the imaginations of other childr en.
D. It suggests that John longs t o experience a lar ger lif e outside the Florida woods.
ID: 5336f2e4  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it accur ately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text
establishes that John has a str ong imagination and then goes on t o describe the St. John Riv er near John ’s home in the Florida
woods. The underlined sentence depicts John sending twigs sailing down the riv er while he imagines them r eaching “Jacksonville,
the sea, the wide world, ” wher e he wishes he could follow . This suggests that John longs t o expand his lif e experiences be yond the
Florida woods.
Choice A is incorr ect because the second and thir d sentences of the text pr ovide an extended description of the riv erbank wher e
John lik es to go, wher eas the underlined sentence describes what John does at that location. Choice B is incorr ect because the
ﬁrst sentence of the text suggests that John ’s beha vior “ was puzzling” t o others ar ound him, wher eas the underlined sentence
concerns the content of John ’s imaginings. Choice C is incorr ect because the underlined sentence elabor ates on John ’s
imagination but doesn ’t mention any other childr en to whom John could be compar ed.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The author describes Cok etown as ha ving str eets that ar e all v ery similar and r esidents who liv e
similarly and do the same work. This r epetition of similarities emphasiz es how e verything in Cok etown is alik e.
Choice B is incorr ect. While the text mentions that all the r esidents “ do the same work, ” it ne ver explains what that work is or why
everyone does it. Besides, the idea that the y all do the same work is just one of se veral similarities among the t ownspeople
described in the text. Choice C is incorr ect. While the last sentence states that “ every day was the same as y ester day and
tomorr ow, and e very year the counterpar t of the last and the next, ” it ne ver suggests that people actually “lose tr ack of time. ” This
is also t oo narr ow t o be the main idea, since time is just one of many aspects of Cok etown that the text describes as alwa ys being

ID: 1455b754  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the twelfth-centur y Islamic philosopher
Ibn Rushd. As used in this context, "inconsequential t o" means not signiﬁcant t o. Accor ding t o the text, Ibn Rushd’ s works wer e
primarily a vailable in Spain, wher e he liv ed, far fr om centr al ar eas of the Muslim world, a fact that could suppor t the conclusion
that his inﬂuence on Muslim contempor aries was limited. The text implies, howe ver, that r ecent scholarship has shown that his
works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context suppor ts the idea that his works wer en’t
inconsequential t o Islamic thought in this period.
Choice A is incorr ect because the issue under consider ation in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’ s time
had access t o his works, not whether his works wer e "contr oversial among, " or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice
B is incorr ect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’ s era wer e awar e of his works, not that the y wer e
"antagonistic t owar d," or hostile t owar d, them. Ther e is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd’ s writings elicited hostility fr om his
contempor aries. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context, "imitated b y" would mean followed as a model b y. Although the text
implies that Ibn Rushd’ s works wer e at least somewhat a vailable in r egions that wer e at the center of Islamic thought during the
period, it doesn ’t speciﬁcally addr ess in what wa ys his works inﬂuenced contempor ary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn ’t
suppor t the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd’ s works.

A. disengage
B. annotate
C. buttr ess
D. recipr ocate
ID: 7bc05fa2  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the legitimacy of the r eigns of F rench
monar chs such as Hugh Capet and Henr y I. As used in this context, “buttr ess” means t o str engthen or def end. The text indicates
that r egar dless of whether a F rench monar ch’s reign was signiﬁcant or une ventful, each monar ch faced questions about his right
to the thr one. The text goes on t o sa y that in or der t o understand the path of a F rench monar ch’s reign, it’ s impor tant t o understand
what contributed t o the monar ch’s ability t o “hold the thr one.” This context suggests that F rench monar chs such as Hugh Capet
and Henr y I had t o buttr ess, or def end, their right t o be monar ch. 
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o discuss fact ors that enabled a monar ch to “disengage, ” or
withdr aw his right t o the F rench thr one. The text focuses on an examination of people who r eigned as F rench monar chs, not on
people who didn ’t choose t o rule. Choice B is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o discuss fact ors that enabled
a monar ch to “annotate, ” or add notes t o or explain, his right t o the F rench thr one. Nothing in the text suggests that the monar chs
were writing notes about their right t o the thr one; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their r eign, the monar chs
defended their right. Choice D is incorr ect. Sa ying that a monar ch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his r eign
was able t o “recipr ocate ” his right t o the F rench thr one would mean that he either r eturned his right t o the thr one or that he
responded in kind t o the challenge. Neither of these meanings would mak e sense in context because the text focuses on people
who did r eign as F rench monar chs and def ended their right t o do so.

ID: 65406d2c  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text, which is t o describe the family of
plants known as the silv erswor d alliance and explain why the plants came t o exhibit " an extr aordinar y range of phenotypes. " The
text intr oduces the silv erswor d alliance as a family of plants unique t o the Hawaiian Islands, pr esenting those that matur e int o
vines and those that matur e int o shrubs and tr ees as examples of diff erent phenotypes. The text concludes b y explaining that
these plants ar e all descendants of " a single ancestr al tar weed plant" that arriv ed 5 million y ears ago in the Hawaiian Islands,
wher e a " wide v ariety of habitats" dr ove the plant’ s descendants t o adapt and thus diff erentiate themselv es, div ersifying int o a
group of r elated but distinct species with diff erent physical char acteristics.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text explains why the plants within the silv erswor d alliance ha ve varied physical char acteristics,
the text doesn ’t suggest that tar weed is the ancest or of all plants on the Hawaiian Islands. The text states instead that all
members of the silv erswor d alliance descend fr om a single tar weed ancest or. Choice B is incorr ect because while Dubautia carrii
is mentioned as an example of a species in the silv erswor d alliance, no details about its par ticular habitat ar e provided. And
although the text indicates that the Hawaiian Islands ar e home t o "a wide v ariety of habitats, " it doesn ’t describe the speciﬁc
habitat wher e Dubautia carrii  is found. The text discusses the silv erswor d alliance as a whole r ather than focusing on Dubautia
carrii  or any one species within this family . Choice D is incorr ect. Although the silv erswor d alliance is only found on the Hawaiian
Islands and includes " an extr aordinar y range of phenotypes, " the text doesn ’t claim that all plants on the Hawaiian Islands ar e par t
of the alliance. F urthermor e, the text indicates that these plants all " descended fr om a single ancestr al tar weed plant, " not that
there are multiple possible candidates for that ancest or plant.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of testing hypotheses r egar ding usage b y
means of text corpor a. In this context, " supposition " refers t o an assumption or hypothesis that is not y et pr oven. The text explains
that text corpor a can be used for " empirical testing of hypotheses r egar ding the fr equency of typical wor d usage " and then
provides a speciﬁc example of using corpus analysis t o suppor t a claim about the wor d "get." The wor d "supposition " precisely
conv eys this idea of an assumption or hypothesis about wor d frequency that can then be tested against empirical data.
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that someone has a "r ecognition " that the wor d "get" has a high
incidence in English. Recognition implies acknowledging something alr eady established as true or v alid, but the text indicates that
corpus analysis is needed t o suppor t the claim about " get," suggesting its high fr equency wasn ’t alr eady established or pr eviously
known. Choice B is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that someone has a " scheme " that the wor d "get" has a high
incidence in English. A scheme is a plan or systematic arr angement, but the context indicates what’ s needed is a pr eliminar y
hypothesis that can be tested with corpus data, not a plan r elated t o wor d frequency . Choice D is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t
mak e sense t o sa y that someone has a " synopsis" that the wor d "get" has a high incidence in English. A synopsis is a summar y or

Choice B is the best answer . “Indicat or” means “ something that shows or suggests, ” which matches Taleb ’s argument that an

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it r eﬂects how the author of Text 1 would most lik ely respond t o Text 2 based on the
information pr ovided. Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of cr edits t o identify the contribut ors t o video games can pose an

that in ﬁlm and tele vision, on the other hand, cr edits ar e used consistently and ar e valuable t o resear chers studying the cast and
crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asser ts how the consistent use of cr edits beneﬁts scholars of ﬁlm and tele vision, it
can be inf erred that this text’ s author would r espond t o the discussion in Text 2 b y obser ving that the kind of pr oblem faced b y
scholars of video games—the inability t o know who contributed t o a par ticular pr oduction and how—is, in ﬁlm and tele vision
studies, lar gely pr evented b y the widespr ead pr actice of cr edits in these mediums.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used b y ﬁlm and tele vision r esear chers—namely , relying on cr edits t o

Text 1 states that ﬁlms and tele vision shows themselv es, not their r esear chers, r egularly use the method of listing cr edits. Choice
B is incorr ect. It can be inf erred fr om Text 2 that when video games do f eatur e credits, the y have essentially the same function as

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it logically completes the text’ s discussion of impor ted goods and consumer prices. In this
context, " nullify " most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that impor ting goods t o a countr y can r educe
consumer prices in that countr y, then cautions that the costs of tr anspor ting goods within the countr y is also a fact or. These
transpor tation costs lik ely raise the prices that must be paid b y people who liv e far fr om the por ts of entr y. Ther efore, the
intranational tr anspor tation costs could nullify the price adv antages t o consumers of impor ting goods.
Choice B is incorr ect. In this context, " denigr ate" would most nearly mean dispar age or deny the impor tance of. Since
transpor tation costs would not be capable of denying the impor tance of price adv antages, it would not mak e sense t o state that

ID: 74ee7737  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Carmen Lomas Garza ’s artistic pr ocess.
In this context, "inspir ed b y" means inﬂuenced b y or motiv ated b y. The text r efers t o how , regar dless of the scale of the work, Garza
uses her memories of Texas and details fr om California t o create her ar t. If Garza is basing her work on her dir ect experiences,
then the y pla y a par t in her ar tistic pr ocess. This context thus suggests that Garza ’s art is inspir ed b y the experiences of her
childhood in Texas and her curr ent lif e in California.
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e logical sense t o indicate that Garza is " complimented b y"—or pr aised b y—
something inanimate such as dir ect experience. Choice B is incorr ect because describing Garza as "uncer tain about"—or unsur e or
doubtful of—dir ect experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza wer e unsur e of her experiences, that would
suggest that she couldn ’t recall them, and Garza wouldn ’t be able t o represent dir ect experience in her ar t if she wer e uncer tain of
the memories or details. Choice C is incorr ect because describing Garza as "unbother ed b y"—or uninter ested in—her experience
would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about Garza ’s artistic pr ocess. The text indicates that Garza ’s art comes fr om
memories of her childhood in Texas and details of her surr oundings in California.

D. It reveals that upon r eturning after an extended absence, the speak er longs for the wa y a location once f elt.
ID: 809addda  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined lines in the text as a whole. In the
opening line of the text, the speak er describes wandering in " alien lands, " which establishes that the speak er is tr aveling in
unfamiliar territ ory. In the underlined lines, the speak er describes "billows" (lar ge wa ves) r olling in the soul, which suggests that the
speak er feels inner turmoil. The underlined lines go on t o associate these r olling billows with v oices calling t o the speak er from
the speak er’s "nativ e str ands, " or homeland, indicating that thoughts of home ar e prompting the emotional experience these lines
describe. Taken together , the imager y in the underlined lines thus implies that the speak er feels a deep emotional connection t o, or
pull t owar d, home while tr aveling in an unfamiliar place.
Choice A is incorr ect. While the text’ s ﬁrst line states that the speak er is tr aveling and the underlined lines indicate that the speak er
experiences an emotional pull t owar d home, neither the underlined lines nor the text as a whole establishes an enthusiasm about
the curr ent tr avels that conﬂicts with a gr owing ur ge to return home. The text’ s description of the lands the speak er is tr aveling in
focuses on their ar tiﬁcial quality , stating, "Natur e her pr erogativ e resigns / To Man, " which doesn ’t suggest enthusiasm but r ather a
sense of detachment or e ven critique. Choice B is incorr ect because the underlined lines don ’t addr ess uncer tainty about
maintaining links with r elativ es in distant places. In the underlined lines, the speak er expr esses a sense of connection t o the
speak er’s homeland (" nativ e str ands") but doesn ’t refer to any family members the speak er ma y have ther e or t o concerns about
maintaining any familial ties. Choice D is incorr ect because the poem doesn ’t indicate that the speak er has r eturned home after an
absence. Rather , the speak er explicitly states, "I wander among the hills of alien lands, " establishing that the curr ent setting is a
foreign place. Mor eover, the underlined lines expr ess a sense of connection with, or pull t owar d, a distant homeland, not a sense
of longing for how that homeland or any other location once f elt.

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . Both authors mention how consumer beha viors ha ve shifted, and how this aff ects diff erent aspects
of the music industr y. Text 1 states that consumers enjo y pur chasing “liv ed experiences, ” and that this inﬂuences how or ganiz ers
design music f estiv als. Text 2 states that consumers ar e using str eaming ser vices mor e, and that this r educes album sales and
increases the impor tance of liv e per formances for musicians.
Choice A is incorr ect. Neither text claims that consumers pr efer str eaming t o festiv als, or that these ar e mutually ex clusiv e
options. Text 1 implies that f estiv als ar e popular and pr oﬁtable, and Text 2 ne ver suggests that str eaming ser vices diminish the
demand for liv e music. Choice B is incorr ect. This choice misr eads Text 1, which identiﬁes music f estiv als as just one example of
a broader tr end of pur chasing “liv ed experiences. ” Text 2 doesn ’t mention gr owing inter est in pur chasing experiences, in the music
industr y or other wise. Choice D is incorr ect. Neither text establishes a cause/eff ect r elationship between the demand for f estiv als
and the demand for str eaming platforms. Text 1 does not mention str eaming platforms at all, and Text 2 does not imply that
streaming platforms beneﬁt fr om the popularity of f estiv als.

ID: f7d58b53  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of self-go vernment among the Muscogee
(Creek) Nation. In this context, “implement” means t o carr y out or put int o eff ect. The text states that the National Council
gener ates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials ar e responsible for “ devising policies and administering ser vices in
accor dance with ” those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials implement the laws: the y put the
laws int o eff ect b y creating policies and administering ser vices that accor d with those laws.
Choice B is incorr ect because “ presume ” in this context would mean t o assume based on incomplete information, and the text
does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials either made assumptions about the content of the laws or had
incomplete information about them. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context “impr ovise” would mean t o create something
without pr epar ation, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials cr eate policies and administer
services without adv ance pr epar ation. Choice D is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that the principal chief and
cabinet oﬃcials “ mimic, ” or imitate, the laws gener ated b y the National Council. To mimic laws would mean t o gener ate new laws
that ar e imitations of existing laws, but the text indicates that the National Council, not the principal chief and cabinet oﬃcials, is

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, "inv ent" most nearly means cr eate or mak e up. The text begins b y stating
that Sar a likes to tell st ories and thor oughly enjo ys telling them. The r est of the text describes how she looks and acts when she
invents, or cr eates, " wonder ful things" in her st ories (" what she t old").
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text suggests that Sar a mak es up " wonder ful things, " nothing suggests that she does so t o
mislead, or intentionally deceiv e, others; ther e is no r eason t o assume that Sar a’s listeners don ’t know that she ’s creating the
stories she shar es. Choice B is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that Sar a is disguising, or tr ying t o co ver up or
conceal, " wonder ful things" when she tells st ories; r ather , she is cr eating them and pr esenting them in wa ys that mak e them "lo vely

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . "Asser ted" means " stated conﬁdently ." Eastlak e "did not hesitate t o publish r eviews going against
popular opinion, " so we can assume that she was conﬁdent in sharing her opinions.
Choice A is incorr ect. "Exposed" means " made visible b y unco vering" and, when talking about ideas, tends t o be used in r elation t o
unco vering the truth. Eastlak e was sharing an opinion, not unco vering a truth. Choice C is incorr ect. "Disco vered" means "found, "
but Eastlak e was writing an opinion essa y. She was writing her own opinion, not " disco vering" a new univ ersal truth. Choice D is
incorr ect. "Doubted" means " didn ’t belie ve in." We’re told that Eastlak e "questioned" the idea that phot ography could be ﬁne ar t.
Placing " doubted" in the blank would actually suggest that Eastlak e argued that phot os wer e valuable for cr eativity and not for

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of deliv ering biomolecules t o plant cells. In
this context, “ overcome ” means t o succeed in dealing with an obstacle. The text suggests that although it’ s diﬃcult t o mo ve

Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o sa y that Landr y and her colleagues ha ve shown that it ma y be
possible t o “conceptualiz e,” or form an idea of, the diﬃculty of tr ansmitting biomolecules thr ough the walls of plant cells. The text
presents this diﬃculty as a known pr oblem that Landr y and her colleagues think the y ma y have solv ed, not as a mysterious
occurr ence that the y have yet to form ideas about. Choice B is incorr ect because the text suggests that Landr y and her colleagues
think it ma y be possible t o successfully deal with the pr oblem of tr ansmitting biomolecules thr ough the walls of plant cells, not
that Landr y and her colleagues think it ma y be possible t o “neglect, ” or simply t o disr egar d and ignor e the pr oblem. Choice C is

Accor ding t o the text, carbon nanotubes allow molecules t o be tr ansmitted t o plant cells—something that is other wise diﬃcult t o

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion about the r elationship between ﬁne ar t and

The text also pr esents the critics’ view as being inﬂuenced b y a per ception that ﬁne ar tists cr eate works that ar e “timeless” and

suggests that the critics belie ve that ﬁne ar t and fashion tend not t o overlap—in other wor ds, that the y rarely intersect. 
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o sa y that critics contend that ﬁne ar t and fashion r arely “prevail,”
or pr ove to be triumphant or widespr ead. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an ar tist who demonstr ates that it’ s
possible t o mak e ﬁne ar t that is also a vailable t o the public as fashion. Choice B is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in
context t o sa y that ﬁne ar t and fashion r arely “succumb, ” or surr ender . The text establishes that unlik e what critics belie ve, Okuma

rarely o verlap, not that the y rarely succumb. Choice C is incorr ect because sa ying that critics belie ve that ﬁne ar t and fashion r arely
“diverge,” or disagr ee or mo ve in diff erent dir ections, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text pr esents Okuma ’s work as both ﬁne

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of manul cats. The text states that manul
cats liv e in " out-of-the-wa y par ts of Asia " (citing the famously r emote Mount E verest as an example) and indicates that it is diﬃcult
to resear ch the cats because of the location of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats ar e remote in r elation t o humans,
the text conv eys that being " distant fr om," or far fr om, lar ge gr oups of humans mak es manul cats challenging t o study .
Choice A is incorr ect because sa ying that the habitats of manul cats ar e "full of lar ge populations of humans" would indicate that
the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would dir ectly contr adict the text’ s claim that the cats liv e in " out-of-the-wa y" areas.
Choice B is incorr ect because the missing wor ds describe an aspect of manul cats’ habitats, or the ar eas wher e the y live, and it

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the o verall structur e of the text. The text begins b y describing a
study ’s ﬁnding about gr eater shor t-nosed fruit bats—namely , that high moonlight intensity inhibits the bats’ activity—and also
accounts for that ﬁnding, stating that this occurs because the potential incr ease in for aging success that gr eater lunar intensity
enables doesn ’t offset these bats’ incr eased vulner ability t o predat ors (whose vision is also implied t o become mor e acute under
intense moonlight). The text goes on t o char acteriz e this ﬁnding as r epresentativ e of a gener al pattern, stating that many
nocturnal mammals beha ve similarly in r esponse t o changes in lunar intensity . The text concludes b y describing an ex ception t o
this pattern, explaining that mongoose lemurs displa y an opposite tendency because the y rely hea vily on visual for aging. This
strategy pr esumably would allow them t o deriv e mor e beneﬁt fr om gr eater lunar intensity than many other nocturnal mammals
would, r esulting in a " different balance of r ewar d and risk" than exists for other nocturnal mammals. Ther efore, the o verall
structur e of the text is best described as a description and account of a ﬁnding, a char acterization of that ﬁnding as r epresentativ e
of a pattern, and then a description and account of an ex ception t o that pattern.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text discusses two diff erent r esponses t o variations in moonlight intensity , explaining that as
moonlight intensity incr eases, gr eater shor t-nosed fruit bats and many other nocturnal mammals decr ease their for aging activity
but mongoose lemurs incr ease their for aging activity , it doesn ’t lea ve one of these r esponses unexplained. The text accounts for
both the typical r esponse t o incr eased lunar intensity (r educed activity due t o predation risk) and the ex ception (incr eased activity
due t o a r eliance on visual for aging) b y making r eference t o a cost-beneﬁt fr amework. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text

contr ast this beha vior with the fact that mongoose lemurs displa y the opposite r esponse t o incr eased lunar intensity , the text
doesn ’t explicitly inv oke other studies and doesn ’t attribute this diff erence in obser ved beha vior t o the fact that the study of gr eater

D. impr actical
ID: 3654202f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of wa ys to detect people thr ough walls. In
this context, "inexpensiv e" means less costly or low in price. The passage describes two kinds of methods that can be used t o
"detect objects or people thr ough walls": r adar and sonar , and changes t o the Wi-Fi technology used in smar tphones. The wor d
"compar atively" befor e the blank indicates that the best answer would be one that helps t o describe a comparison between the
two. Radar and sonar ar e described as " costly ," while the method that uses Wi-Fi technology is described as " cheap "; ther efore, it
would be compar atively affor dable, or inexpensiv e.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that a small modiﬁcation t o the smar tphones that many consumers alr eady own
would pr esumably r esult in consumers using that technology t o detect objects or people thr ough walls mor e regularly , or
frequently; ther efore, it would not be true that such technology would be compar atively infr equent, or uncommon. Choice C is
incorr ect because ther e is nothing in the text t o indicate that either r adar and sonar or changes t o smar tphone Wi-Fi technology
are capable of being misunderst ood or mistak en for something else; ther efore, it would not mak e sense t o describe changes t o
Wi-Fi smar tphone technology as compar atively unmistakable, or indisputable. Choice D is incorr ect because the text indicates that
a small modiﬁcation t o the smar tphones that many consumers alr eady own and carr y with them would be mor e functional or
practical than r adar and sonar , not mor e impr actical, or unr ealistic.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text, which is t o show how P olly
reacted t o some of F anny ’s other friends. The text describes P olly as being frightened of F anny ’s friends because the y seemed
“much older and wiser ” to her and elabor ates that the y “talk ed about things of which ” Polly was unfamiliar , uninter ested, and
shock ed. Thus, the main purpose of the text is t o describe P olly’s impr essions of F anny ’s other friends. 
Choice B is incorr ect because the text does not pr ovide any of the t opics P olly discussed with F anny ’s friends, stating only that
Polly found the t opics unfamiliar , uninter esting, and shocking. Choice C is incorr ect because the text sa ys nothing about how
Fanny and her other friends ﬁrst met. Choice D is incorr ect because the focus of the text is on P olly’s feelings about F anny ’s other

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text, which is t o illustr ate two
appr oaches that Indigenous politicians ha ve tak en to achie ve political r epresentation for their communities. The text begins b y
explaining that one appr oach is ex empliﬁed b y Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effor t to ensur e that the
inter ests of their communities ar e represented in go vernment, joined pr eexisting political par ties and wer e subsequently elected t o
Congr ess. The text goes on t o highlight a second appr oach adopted b y Indigenous leaders in Canada and se veral Latin American
countries: r ather than joining established political par ties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries ha ve instead formed
their own par ties t o promote candidates for oﬃce who suppor t causes that ar e impor tant t o their communities. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text’ s focus is on the contr asting appr oaches adopted b y diff erent Indigenous political
movements in diff erent countries; thus, it isn ’t accur ate t o sa y that the text tr aces the hist ory of one political mo vement. Mor eover,
the text only discusses examples fr om 2000 t o 2021, a r elativ ely shor t period of time; ther efore, it pr ovides v ery little in the wa y of
discussion of lar ger hist orical de velopments, nor does it mak e any pr edictions about how these mo vements might continue t o
develop in the futur e. Choice B is incorr ect because the text ne ver ur ges Indigenous politicians in the US t o alter their str ategy of
striving for r epresentation thr ough the established political par ties, nor does it suggest that this str ategy is inf erior t o that of
Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who ha ve formed their own par ties. In fact, the text notes that both str ategies
have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians t o national go vernments. Choice D is incorr ect because the text ne ver
suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US ha ve inﬂuenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it str esses how
Indigenous politicians’ appr oach t owar d achie ving r epresentation in the US go vernment has diff ered fr om the appr oach

ID: 2b085bc6  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. The narr ator describes how Joe
responds t o being in “the metr opolis”: he ’s excited and “ wild with enthusiasm. ” He also envies the y oung f ellows who walk b y
because, dr essed as the y are, the y look as if the y have somewher e special t o go. The text contr asts this new place with the place
Joe comes fr om, wher e appar ently ther e wasn ’t as much t o do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is t o illustr ate Joe ’s reaction t o
a new envir onment.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text mak es no r eference t o why Joe has mo ved. The narr ator indicates that Joe is enthusiastic
about being in a city , but ther e’s no explanation pr ovided for the mo ve. Choice C is incorr ect because the text mak es no r eference
to how Joe thinks about an e vent. The narr ator describes y oung men passing b y in the e vening and then r ecalls places wor th
going t o at home—chur ch and a f ew people ’s houses—but ther e’s no explicit comparison made nor is a time of da y mentioned for
these e vents back home. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suppor t the idea that Joe f eels r egret over lea ving home.
Instead, Joe is described as “ wild with enthusiasm ” at being in the city . Joe ’s home is mentioned, but only t o compar e it

Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of o ysters and ocean r ecor dings. As used in
this context, "r esponsiv e" means r eacting positiv ely. The text pr esents a ﬁnding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean
sounds ma y encour age o yster lar vae to establish a r eef (a permanent home): gr oups of o yster lar vae that hear d recor ded sounds
of a healthy o yster r eef wer e two times mor e likely to show signs of forming their own r eef than gr oups that hear d diff erent ocean
recor dings wer e. This context conv eys that the gr oups that hear d healthy r eef sounds had a mor e positiv e reaction than the other
groups did—that is, the y wer e the most r esponsiv e.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy o yster r eef caused some gr oups of o yster

sounds wer e obser ved engaging in activity: the y wer e two times mor e likely to create a r eef (a permanent home) than gr oups that
hear d diff erent ocean sounds wer e. Choice C is incorr ect because describing the gr oups of o yster lar vae that hear d sounds of a
healthy o yster r eef as most "lik ed," or r egar ded with pleasur e, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a
study found that healthy r eef sounds ma y encour age gr oups of o yster lar vae to form r eefs (permanent homes), not on the idea
that some of the gr oups in the study wer e liked mor e than others. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that
hearing sounds of a healthy o yster r eef caused some gr oups of o yster lar vae to be " distr essed, " or t o experience diﬃculty or begin
to decline. Instead, the text indicates that the sounds incr eased the lik elihood that gr oups of lar vae would establish a r eef (a

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, " determine " most nearly means choose or decide. The text indicates that
Mr. Ryder "had made up his mind" t o ask a woman t o marr y him but had not y et "spok en"—that is, he had not y et ask ed her . The
text also indicates that Mr . Ryder " decided" t o thr ow a par ty for the woman and ask her during it. This context conv eys that after
making up his mind t o propose, what Mr . Ryder had t o do was determine, or choose, the time t o do it.
Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, " determine " doesn ’t mean inﬂuence, or aff ect or contr ol. The text isn ’t indicating that
Mr. Ryder is contr olling time itself; such a thing isn ’t possible. Rather , the text conv eys that after making up his mind t o ask a
woman t o marr y him, Mr . Ryder had t o mak e another decision about his own actions b y selecting a time t o propose. Choice C is
incorr ect. The text focuses on Mr . Ryder’s plan t o ask a woman t o marr y him and his decision about when t o ask her . This context
conv eys that after making up his mind t o propose, Mr . Ryder had t o choose the time, not that he had t o demonstr ate, or show , the

ID: f8ca5766  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Cole ’s book Blind Spot . In this context,
“enthusiasm for ” means ex citement about. The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original phot ographs as well as poetic
prose—two elements that corr espond t o Cole ’s passions, identiﬁed in the text, for phot ography and the written wor d. This context
suggests that Cole ’s excitement about phot ography and writing led him t o create a book that successfully combines the two
mediums.
Choice A is incorr ect because describing Cole as f eeling “indiff erence t o” his two passions wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. If Cole
is indiff erent t o his passions, that would mean he doesn ’t car e about phot ography or writing—in which case the y wouldn ’t be his
passions at all. Choice C is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that Cole f eels “ concern about, ” or uneasiness
about, his passions. The text’ s use of the wor d “culminates” indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole ’s
passions, not a work that r esults fr om his sense of discomfor t with phot ography and writing. Choice D is incorr ect because ther e’s
nothing in the text t o suggest that Cole f eels “ surprise at, ” or ast onished b y, his passions. The text indicates that Cole ’s feeling
about his passions “ culminates” in a book that “ evocativ ely” combines phot ographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-

Choice B is incorr ect. Although in some contexts, “ drew” can r efer to draining or r emo ving liquid, especially water , as when

ID: 0b5ecf0e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. The text describes two types of
libraries in ﬁrst-centur y BCE Rome—priv ate libr aries contr olled b y wealthy individuals, and the public libr aries lik e that
commissioned b y Emper or Augustus—and then notes that "these two tr aditions ar en’t as distinct as the y seem. " It explains that
both priv ate-libr ary owners and the emper or saw their libr aries as " extensions of their personal patr onage, just on v astly diff ering
scales, " because the emper or’s patr onage extended t o the whole citiz enry of Rome. Thus, both priv ate and public libr aries in
ancient Rome wer e fundamentally tied t o relevant principles of patr onage.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text mentions that Rome ’s republican period only t o sa y that it " ended in the ﬁrst centur y BCE, "
thus it doesn ’t suppor t any conclusions about possible occurr ences "thr oughout Rome ’s republican period. " Choice B is incorr ect.
The text neither discusses " early imperial leaders in Rome, " nor whether their le vel of inﬂuence was appr opriate. Rather it
discusses the end of "Rome ’s republican period" in r elation t o libr aries, who cr eated them, and who got t o use them without
passing judgment on pr opriety . Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text indicates that Rome ’s republican period " ended in the ﬁrst

Choice A is the best answer because is accur ately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins b y declaring that although
a song is "but a little thing, " or seemingly insigniﬁcant, singing it brings jo y and giv es the speak er of the text "z est," or ex citement, in

Thus, the main purpose of the text is t o conv ey how engaging in song mak es the speak er feel.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text mentions a shepher d, it neither indicates that the shepher d is singing nor does it compar e
the shepher d to the speak er. Choice C is incorr ect. The text indicates that the speak er works har d, engaging in "hours of t oil," and it
can be inf erred that the speak er lik ely liv es in a rur al ar ea, since cows and a cowbell can be hear d nearb y. Howe ver, the text does
not suggest that the speak er is a farmer or f eels ex cited about farming. Mor eover, the shepher d in the text is not a liter al reference

realism, American pop ar t uses vivid colors, and inter tribal ﬂatstyle r ejects the use of shading and perspectiv e to achie ve depth.
This context suggests that the styles that ha ve inﬂuenced Cannon ’s work ar e dispar ate. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that ther e is a tension among the inﬂuences on Cannon ’s artwork, so it wouldn ’t

Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. The
ﬁrst two sentences of the text establish that in California, houses wer e heated b y building ﬁr es year-r ound. The underlined por tion

oceans of the world.
As used in the text, what does the wor d “conceiv able ” most nearly mean?
A. Obvious
B. Imaginable
C. Straightfor ward
D. Uninterrupted
ID: ba974387  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, " conceiv able " most nearly means capable of being thought of or
imagined. The text describes a journe y that, despite being "insigniﬁcant in distance, " was "b y no means an easy one " because of
the v ariety of obstacles that " natur e had determined t o thr ow…in the wa y." To emphasiz e the diﬃculty of the journe y, the author
portrays natur e as activ ely scheming t o present tr avelers with e very obstacle that can be thought of—i.e., e very imaginable
obstacle.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " conceiv able " does not mean ob vious, or e vident. Instead, b y referring t o "every
conceiv able obstacle, " the text suggests a wide v ariety of challenges b y evoking all the potential diﬃculties natur e could pr esent,
not just those that the tr avelers might r easonably expect or for esee. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context, " conceiv able "
does not mean str aightfor ward, or easy t o negotiate. The text is not indicating that the obstacles wer e simple t o respond t o and
overcome. Rather , the text suggests that a wide r ange of obstacles made the journe y diﬃcult. Choice D is incorr ect because in this
context, " conceiv able " does not mean uninterrupted. Although the text suggests that the obstacles wer e frequent and numer ous, it
does not emphasiz e the obstacles’ continuity; instead, the text conv eys their unexpected v ariety and r ange.

San F rancisco is known for the color ful mur als painted on many of its buildings. The densest collection of mur als is found on

D. To describe the rise of mur al painting in San F rancisco beginning in the 1970s
ID: c8603ed7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins b y brieﬂy stating that San
Francisco is known for its mur als, then tr ansitions t o a discussion of a single collection of mur als, which is found on Balmy Alle y in
the city ’s Mission District. The text explains that the mur als in this ar ea wer e originally cr eated in the 1970s, then obser ves that
they have changed o ver time: as some ha ve faded thr ough the decades, others ha ve been painted in their place. The text ends b y
emphasizing that these mur als ar e signiﬁcant because the y reﬂect San F rancisco ’s artistic spirit and cultur al life. Ther efore, the
text pr ovides an o verview of the hist ory and impor tance of the Balmy Alle y mur als.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although it can be inf erred fr om the text that ther e are mur als in other ar eas of San F rancisco besides Balmy
Alley, the text doesn ’t speciﬁcally discuss mur als in other ar eas or compar e the mur als of Balmy Alle y to those in other ar eas.
Choice C is incorr ect. By obser ving that some of the mur als of Balmy Alle y have been r eplaced due t o fading, the text implies that
murals can deca y, but it ne ver ur ges r eaders t o protect this speciﬁc collection of mur als—or any mur als elsewher e in San
Francisco, for that matter . Indeed, b y describing the e ver-changing mur als of Balmy Alle y as “ a living showcase of San F rancisco ’s
artistic spirit, ” the text emphasiz es the positiv e aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alle y mur als ha ve faded and been
replaced with new mur als. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t describe the rise of mur al painting in San F rancisco
gener ally or note when this occurr ed. The only hist orical de velopment of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the mur als
in a speciﬁc ar ea of the city: Balmy Alle y in the Mission District.

ID: 9c759a09  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it accur ately states the text’ s main purpose. The poem begins with the speak er ur ging a child
to “go for th” with her encour agement (“ my hear t’s desir e”). The speak er goes on t o suggest that new experiences (“Gr eat r eaches,
yet unknown ”) lie ahead for the son that “lif e is calling” him t o seek out. Thus, the main purpose is t o encour age a child t o embr ace
the experiences a vailable t o him in his lif e.
Choice A is incorr ect because the speak er encour ages the child t o pursue new experiences (“Gr eat r eaches”) without knowing
exactly what those experiences will be (“y et unknown ”) or suggesting that the y should match the speak er’s own accomplishments.
Choice B is incorr ect because the speak er focuses on positiv e possibilities for her son (“Gr eat r eaches, y et unknown ”) and her
enthusiastic encour agement t o embr ace those possibilities (“lif e is calling y ou!”), while ther e is no mention of r aising a child or
associated struggles. Choice C is incorr ect because the speak er frames the possibilities for her son in a positiv e light when she
says that “ great r eaches, y et unknown ” are waiting for him, and this positiv e outlook for the son is consistent thr oughout the text.

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of businesses being f eatur ed in The
Illustr ated Hist ory of San Mateo County . In this context, " advantageous" means beneﬁcial or pr oviding a fa vorable position. The text
explains that being included in the book " suggested that a business was an impor tant par t of the community ," and it can be
inferred that an enhanced r eputation within the local community would beneﬁt a business, commer cially or other wise. This
context suppor ts the idea that being f eatur ed in this publication would be adv antageous.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, "risky " would suggest that being f eatur ed in The Illustr ated Hist ory of San Mateo
County  might ha ve negativ e consequences for a business. Howe ver, the text implies only positiv e outcomes since inclusion
indicated impor tance within the local community . Choice B is incorr ect because " misleading" would mean deceptiv e or
deliber ately giving a wr ong impr ession, but the text doesn ’t indicate ther e was something deceptiv e about being f eatur ed in The
Illustr ated Hist ory of San Mateo County ; rather , it suggests that inclusion indicated community impor tance. Choice D is incorr ect
because "unr emarkable " would mean common or or dinar y, which doesn ’t mak e sense in context. The text suggests that inclusion
in The Illustr ated Hist ory of San Mateo County  instead conf erred a special status on a business b y conv eying its impor tance in the

A. Gentle
B. Sensitiv e
C. Shapeless
D. Bland
ID: 05575bca  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, " soft" most nearly means gentle. The text por trays Alice speaking about
the snow falling against the window , describing it as sounding " nice" and similar t o someone "kissing the window ." These details
most str ongly suggest that Alice thinks the sound made b y the snow falling against the window is gentle.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although in some contexts, " gentle " can mean sensitiv e, or caring about others’ f eelings, that isn ’t the
meaning in this context; it doesn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that Alice thinks the sound of the snow car es about anything. Choice C is
incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is shapeless, or lacks a deﬁnite shape; she isn ’t
indicating how anything looks or f eels but, r ather , is describing how " nice" and gentle the snow sounds. Choice D is incorr ect
because the text doesn ’t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninter esting; r ather , she notices the sound

ID: c7265342  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the o verall structur e of the text. The text ﬁrst establishes the setting, a " still
lagoon, " and then goes on t o provide mor e details about the lagoon b y presenting se veral descriptiv e images of natur e, including a
lizard that " shrills his tune, " "oozing lichens, " and "thick, gr ey and humid" v apors.
Choice A is incorr ect. Instead of simply naming species, the text pr esents descriptiv e images of natur e; fur ther, instead of naming
animals and then mo ving on t o name plants, the text r efers ﬁrst t o a plant ("the wild rice "), then t o two animals ("the lizar d," "the

Choice D is the best answer . Both authors agr ee that L udingt on’s story has been widely celebr ated and r evered b y Americans, e ven

states that many ar ticles and books ha ve been written about her . Thus, both authors acknowledge the popularity of L udingt on’s
story.
Choice A is incorr ect. Neither author claims that L udingt on had a signiﬁcant impact on the war . Text 1 doesn ’t mention how

ID: c6bd3447  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined por tions in the text as a whole.
The underlined por tions describe the y oung ar tists and intellectuals at the gathering as tr ying t o "hew out, " or giv e shape t o, their
views of ar t mor e clearly , but with each seeming t o be using " an ill-balanced ax e" and then f eeling that the " strokes had gone awr y."
In context, the metaphorical language comparing attempts t o reﬁne concepts of ar t to impr ecisely cutting wood with an
inadequate ax e ser ves to emphasiz e how much the individuals at the gathering struggled t o articulate, or expr ess, their thoughts;
indeed, the text explains that the individuals couldn ’t quite gr asp why their statements had gone awr y and tended t o try to rectify ,
or corr ect, them in continued discussion after the y sat down.
Choice A is incorr ect because the underlined por tions char acteriz e aspects of the y oung ar tists and intellectuals’ attempts t o
present their gener al views of ar t mor e clearly , not their views of the r eputation of a cer tain ar twork; the text ne ver mentions any
speciﬁc ar twork or its r eputation. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the underlined por tions r efer to a physical activity—cutting wood
with an ax e—the descriptions ar e metaphorical r ather than liter al. The text isn ’t describing people constructing works of ar t, lar ge-
scale or other wise; r ather , it’s describing people talking at a gathering, using the idea of impr ecisely cutting wood with an
inadequate ax e to suggest that each individual struggled when tr ying t o present their view of ar t mor e clearly . Choice C is
incorr ect. Although the underlined por tions do pr ovide a r eason for the y oung ar tists and intellectuals’ discontent, the text focuses
on the fact that the y wer e each dissatisﬁed with their own statements, not on how the y felt about the gr oup’s full conv ersation
about ar t. Instead, the text explains that each individual tried t o present their view of ar t mor e clearly but struggled (as if
impr ecisely cutting wood with an inadequate ax e), couldn ’t grasp what went awr y, and then f elt the need t o rectify , or corr ect, what
they had just said. It’ s possible that the individuals wer e also discontented with the gr oup’s conv ersation o verall, but neither the

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically and pr ecisely completes the text’ s discussion of studies of altitude ’s eff ect
on blood chemistr y. In this context, “ paucity of ” means lack of. In describing the inspir ation behind Al-Sweedan and Alhaj’ s
resear ch, the text uses the wor d “though ” to suggest a contr asting r elationship between two types of studies: those examining the
effect on blood chemistr y of living at a high altitude and those examining the eff ect on blood chemistr y of living in locations below
sea le vel. This contr asting r elationship and the text’ s use of the wor d “many ” provide context suggesting that ther e are few, if any ,

Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context for ther e to be a “ quarr el about, ” or open disagr eement about,

chemistr y of living at a high altitude and those examining the eff ect on blood chemistr y of living in locations below sea le vel.
Ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that the contr ast between the two types of studies inv olves the extent t o which r esear chers
broadly agr ee or disagr ee about the contents of either type. Choice C is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context for

The text’ s use of the wor ds “though ” and “ many ” suggests a contr asting r elationship in terms of amount between two types of
studies: those examining the eff ect on blood chemistr y of living at a high altitude and those examining the eff ect on blood

the two types of studies ar e similar in terms of amount, with many examples existing of both types. Choice D is incorr ect because
it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context for ther e to be a “v erisimilitude in, ” or appear ance of truth in, studies of the eff ect on blood

In habitats with limited nutrients, cer tain fungus species gr ow on the r oots of tr ees, engaging in mutually beneﬁcial r elationships
known as ect omy corrhizae: in this symbiotic ex change, the tr ee pr ovides the fungus with carbon, a nutrient necessar y for both
species, and the fungus ______  by enhancing the tr ee’s ability t o absorb nitr ogen, another k ey nutrient, fr om the soil.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. overreacts
B. recipr ocates
C. retaliates
D. deviates
ID: 1ad04ea0  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of ect omy corrhizae r elationships. In this
context, “r ecipr ocates” means r esponds in kind or degr ee. The text indicates that the r elationship between cer tain fungi and tr ees
in some habitats is “ mutually beneﬁcial” and inv olves a “ symbiotic ex change ” in which each or ganism helps the other access an
impor tant nutrient. In other wor ds, each or ganism pr ovides the same kind of beneﬁt it r eceiv es: the tr ee pr ovides a nutrient
(carbon) for the fungus and the fungus r ecipr ocates b y helping the tr ee to absorb mor e of another nutrient (nitr ogen).
Choice A is incorr ect because the text emphasiz es that the r elationship between cer tain fungi and tr ees in some habitats inv olves
a “symbiotic ex change ” in which each or ganism helps the other access an impor tant nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the
fungus “ overreacts, ” or r esponds t oo str ongly , by allowing the tr ee to be better able t o absorb a beneﬁcial nutrient. Choice C is
incorr ect because “r etaliates” means r esponds t o a harmful action with a similarly harmful action. The text indicates that the
relationship between cer tain fungi and tr ees in some habitats is “ mutually beneﬁcial” and inv olves a “ symbiotic ex change ” in which
each or ganism helps the other , not that the r elationship is one in which the or ganisms harm one another . Choice D is incorr ect. In
this context, “ deviates” would mean depar ts from an established course or norm. The text explains that the r elationship between
certain fungi and tr ees in some habitats inv olves a “ symbiotic ex change ” in which each or ganism helps the other access an
impor tant nutrient. Because the r elationship inv olves beneﬁts for both the fungus and the tr ee, it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that
the fungus de viates b y helping the tr ee be better able t o absorb a beneﬁcial nutrient.

The following text is adapted fr om Oscar Wilde ’s 1897 nonﬁction work De Pr ofundis . 
People whose desir e is solely for self-r ealisation ne ver know wher e the y are going. They can ’t know . In one sense of the wor d
it is of course necessar y to know oneself: that is the ﬁrst achie vement of knowledge. But t o recognise that the soul of a man

Who can calculate the orbit of his own soul?
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole?
A. It reinfor ces the text’ s skepticism about the possibility of truly achie ving self-knowledge.
B. It speculates that some r eaders will shar e the doubts expr essed in the text about the v alue of self-knowledge.

D. It concedes that the deﬁnition of self-knowledge adv anced in the text is unpopular .
ID: a68239ed  Answer

Choice A is the best answer . The text r epeatedly claims that true self-knowledge can ’t possibly be achie ved, and this rhet orical

A. weak en

ID: 04e4c51d  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of carte de visite  phot os. To "populariz e" a
technology is t o allow it t o be used and appr eciated widely . The text explains that unlik e the phot os pr oduced b y earlier forms of
phot ographic technology , carte de visite  phot os wer e inexpensiv e and could easily be obtained b y "everyday people, " who enjo yed
exchanging the images. Ther efore, carte de visite  phot os helped populariz e phot ography .
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that instead of weak ening the emer ging technology of phot ography , carte de visite
phot os allowed it t o be mor e widely accessed and enjo yed b y people. Choice B is incorr ect. The text establishes that lar ge
numbers of people enjo yed using carte de visite  phot os, so it can be inf erred that these phot os caused phot ography t o be pr aised,

instead, carte de visite  consumers themselv es would ha ve praised it. Choice D is incorr ect because the text explains that r ather

C. It describes par t of the Tule geese ’s typical winter migr ation journe y.
D. It compar es Tule geese t o other bir ds that migr ate south for the winter .
ID: 422c5068  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it best states how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. The ﬁrst sentence
states that Tule geese typically tak e four da ys to migr ate south. Then in the next sentence, which contains the underlined por tion,
the text describes the ﬁrst par t of that journe y, which begins with the geese ﬂying o ver the Gulf of Alaska while k eeping about 100
miles fr om the Canadian shor e. The r est of the text details the r emainder of the geese ’s typical journe y and then mentions
circumstances in 2020 that r esulted in the geese taking an unusually long time t o complete it. Thus, the underlined por tion
describes par t of the Tule geese ’s typical winter migr ation journe y.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text concludes b y stating that in 2020, Tule geese t ook twice as long t o complete their typical
migr ation, which suggests a change in their usual ﬂight beha vior, the underlined por tion doesn ’t discuss this. Instead, the
underlined por tion describes the ﬁrst par t of the Tule geese ’s typical winter migr ation journe y over the Gulf of Alaska. Choice B is
incorr ect. Although the sentence containing the underlined por tion mentions that Tule geese br eed in Alaska, the underlined
portion doesn ’t explain why the geese br eed in that location. Rather , the text mentions Alaska t o explain that it’ s the star ting point
of the Tule geese ’s typical winter migr ation. Choice D is incorr ect because the underlined por tion doesn ’t discuss any other bir ds
that migr ate south for the winter . In fact, the text is only concerned with the migr ation of Tule geese.

D. aggr avate
ID: 479c7e82  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Book er T. Whatle y. In this context,
“hinder ” means hold back or obstruct. The text explains that Whatle y encour aged farms t o allow cust omers on site t o pick their
own pr oduce for a f ee. He did so despite critics’ concerns that the cust omers would ne ver pa y to do so. This context establishes
that the critics’ concerns didn ’t hinder Whatle y’s effor ts to promote the pr actice.
Choice A is incorr ect. The text indicates that critics’ sk epticism of the idea that cust omers would pa y to pick their own pr oduce
didn ’t ha ve some eff ect on Whatle y’s promotion of the pr actice. The text illustr ates this asser tion b y describing Whatle y’s
“determined adv ocacy ” for the pr actice. This context suggests that critics’ concerns didn ’t obstruct Whatle y’s effor ts, not that
critics’ concerns didn ’t “enhance, ” or incr ease or impr ove, Whatle y’s effor ts. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context,
“misr epresent” would mean por tray inaccur ately , and the text includes no information r elevant t o the issue of how Whatle y’s

The text’ s subject is Be verly Glenn-Copeland’ s 1986 album Keyboar d Fantasies , notable for its inno vative, experimental
arrangements. Accor ding t o the text, the album was not initially admir ed, but in r ecent y ears it has become popular among
younger musicians. The underlined por tion of the text mentions two of those musicians, Blood Or ange and Moses Sumne y, who
“cite the album as an inﬂuence. ” Ther efore, the underlined por tion of the text off ers examples of y ounger musicians whose work

Choice A is incorr ect because e ven though the underlined sentence states that Blood Or ange and Moses Sumne y wer e inﬂuenced
by Keyboar d Fantasies , it doesn ’t say that all other musicians should also embr ace the album ’s experimental style. Choice B is
incorr ect. Although the text states that Keyboar d Fantasies  was not admir ed on its ﬁrst r elease, the text doesn ’t present any

Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the Roman emper or Mar cus A urelius. In
this context, "indulge " means tr eat with ex cessiv e leniency . The text states that accor ding t o hist orian E dwar d Gibbon, Mar cus
Aurelius, who was widely consider ed vir tuous, had only a single char acter ﬂaw: his mild temper ament. The text suggests that
because of this ﬂaw , Mar cus A urelius had an o verly permissiv e natur e. This context, in turn, suppor ts the idea that Mar cus A urelius
treated the vices, or e vils, of those ar ound him with ex cessiv e leniency , indulging r ather than punishing those vices.
Choice B is incorr ect. While the text does state that Mar cus A urelius was widely consider ed vir tuous, it giv es no indication that he
was inclined t o "despise, " or hate, others’ vices. Rather , the text suggests that he showed undue t olerance for these vices because
of his o verly permissiv e natur e—that is, his inclination t o allow others t o do as the y wished. Choice C is incorr ect because the
text’s description of Mar cus A urelius as o verly permissiv e suggests that he showed undue t olerance for others’ vices, not that he
tried t o "moder ate" those vices, or lessen their intensity . Choice D is incorr ect because the text’ s description of Mar cus A urelius as

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of no velist Leon F orrest’s admir ation of
William F aulkner ’s writing style. In this context, "imitation " means something that r esembles or r eproduces something else. The
text states that F orrest admir ed F aulkner ’s style and that any one familiar with F aulkner ’s style would be able t o see the stylistic
similarities between a par ticular passage in F orrest’s no vel Divine Da ys and F aulkner ’s writing, a fact that suppor ts the idea that
Forrest’s no vel pa ys tribute t o Faulkner b y reproducing, or imitating, F aulkner ’s style.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, a "for getting" would mean an instance in which something is o verlook ed or not
remember ed. The text emphasiz es Forrest’s admir ation for F aulkner ’s style and the fact that F orrest’s writing in some instances
closely r esembles F aulkner ’s stylistically . It ther efore wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that in tr ying t o pa y tribute t o Faulkner ’s style,
Forrest failed t o remember it. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, a "r ejection " would mean a dismissal of something as
unwor thy. The text emphasiz es Forrest’s admir ation for F aulkner ’s writing style, stating that par ts of F orrest’s writings indicate
effor ts to cop y that style. It wouldn ’t mak e sense ther efore to suggest that F orrest had r ejected or dismissed F aulkner ’s style as
unwor thy. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context, an " opinion " would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on
Forrest’s admir ation of F aulkner , which suggests that F orrest had formed a positiv e judgment of F aulkner ’s style, the wor d opinion
wouldn ’t mak e sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn ’t say that the passage fr om F orrest’s no vel expr esses his view of

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the fossiliz ed bones of the hominin
known as Little F oot. As used in this context, “ compar able t o” would mean similar t o. The text indicates that the r elationship
between the fossiliz ed cla vicle and shoulder bones of Little F oot and the cla vicle and shoulder bones of “fr equent climbers, ” such
as chimpanz ees and gorillas, suggests that Little F oot had adapted t o mo ving ar ound in tr ees. This context suggests that the
relationship between the fossiliz ed bones of Little F oot and the bones of chimpanz ees and gorillas is one of similarity—the Little
Foot fossils ar e likely compar able t o the modern ape bones. 
Choice A is incorr ect because if the fossiliz ed bones of Little F oot wer e “surpassed b y,” or ex ceeded b y or made inf erior t o, the
bones of modern apes that ar e frequent climbers, it wouldn ’t suggest, as the text sa ys, that Little F oot was adapted t o mo ving
around in tr ees. If anything, learning that Little F oot’s cla vicle and shoulder bones wer e surpassed b y those of chimpanz ees and
gorillas would suggest that Little F oot was poorly adapted t o climbing. Choice C is incorr ect because if Little F oot’s fossiliz ed
clavicle and shoulder bones wer e “independent of, ” or not inﬂuenced b y or aﬃliated with, the bones of modern apes that climb
often, it wouldn ’t suggest, as the text sa ys, that Little F oot was adapted t o mo ving ar ound in tr ees. Choice D is incorr ect because
the text indicates that Little F oot’s fossiliz ed bones date t o 3.6 million y ears ago, so the y couldn ’t ha ve been “ obtained fr om,” or

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. multifaceted
B. realistic
C. rousing
D. subtle
ID: 760ee1db  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the pla y’s eff ect on audiences. As used in
this context, “r ousing” means ex citing or ener gizing. The text indicates that critics found the pla y to ha ve “the opposite eff ect” on
audiences of what the pla ywrights hoped for . The critics, the text sa ys, thought the pla y was wear ying r ather than ener gizing t o
viewers. This context suppor ts the idea that the pla ywrights hoped liv e per formances of the pla y would be ener gizing, or r ousing,
to audiences.
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e’s no information in the text suggesting that the pla ywrights hoped liv e per formances of the
play would be “ multifaceted, ” or be v aried or ha ve many aspects. The text indicates that critics found the pla y to be wear ying t o
audiences and that this was the opposite of what the pla ywrights hoped for . Multifaceted is not the opposite of wear ying, but
rousing is, which suggests that the pla ywrights hoped the pla y would be r ousing. Choice B is incorr ect because ther e’s no
information in the text suggesting that the pla ywrights hoped liv e per formances of the pla y would be “r ealistic, ” or lif elike or
sensible. The text sa ys that critics found the pla y to be wear ying t o audiences and that this was the opposite of what the
playwrights hoped for . Realistic is not the opposite of wear ying, but r ousing is, which suggests that the pla ywrights hoped the pla y
would be r ousing. Choice D is incorr ect because ther e’s no information in the text suggesting that the pla ywrights hoped liv e
performances of the pla y would be subtle, or complex or understated. The text sa ys that critics found the pla y to be wear ying t o
audiences and that this was the opposite of what the pla ywrights hoped for . Subtle is not the opposite of wear ying, but r ousing is,
which suggests that the pla ywrights hoped the pla y would be r ousing.

As used in the text, what does the wor d “featur ed” most nearly mean?
A. Displa yed
B. Questioned
C. Appr oved
D. Ignor ed
ID: 417f8dfa  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "f eatur ed" most nearly means displa yed. The text describes Nina ’s
fascination with a fr amed phot ograph. It then goes on t o describe what the phot ograph showed, or displa yed, which is a por trait of
Nina ’s great-gr eat-gr andmother Rosita as a y oung woman. Thus, the text indicates that the phot ograph displa yed a por trait of
Rosita.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text identiﬁes the person shown in the phot ograph as Nina ’s great-gr eat-gr andmother; it giv es no
indication that the contents of the phot ograph wer e questioned, or ask ed about. Choice C is incorr ect because appr oved means
expr essed a fa vorable opinion of, and ther e’s nothing t o suggest that the phot ograph of Nina ’s great-gr eat-gr andmother has
receiv ed appr oval or been viewed fa vorably, only that Nina is unable t o stop looking at it. Choice D is incorr ect because nothing in
the text suggests that the phot ograph Nina is fascinated with ignor ed, or r efused t o tak e notice of, Nina ’s great-gr eat-gr andmother

Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. The text states that
archaeologists r ecently disco vered a well-pr eser ved food shop, or thermopolium , in P ompeii, Italy . The text then fur ther describes
the contents of the disco very and pr ovides an example of what was found. Thus, the o verall purpose of the text is t o present a

ID: c5b1af e5 Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Ik eguchi’ s model of bicy cle supply . In this
context, “ satur ated with ” means thor oughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a pr oblem encounter ed b y some bicy cle-
sharing pr ograms: users can r eturn bicy cles t o diff erent locations than wher e the users pick ed up the bicy cles t o star t, which can
result in a mismatch between bicy cle supply (that is, wher e the bicy cles ar e curr ently located) and user demand (that is, the
locations wher e users ar e hoping t o pick up bicy cles). The text goes on t o explain that Ik eguchi de veloped a wa y to identify when
this mismatch is lik ely to occur . This context suggests that Ik eguchi’ s method will show when it is lik ely that some locations ha ve
an insuﬃcient supply and other locations, b y implicit contr ast, ar e satur ated with bicy cles. 
Choice A is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations ar e “susceptible t o,” or sensitiv e to or easily
inﬂuenced b y, bicy cles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicy cles being r edistributed awa y from locations wher e users want
them, not anything about those locations being inﬂuenced b y the bicy cles. Choice B is incorr ect because the text describes
situations in which some locations ha ve an insuﬃcient supply of bicy cles because the bicy cles ha ve been r elocated elsewher e,
which suggests that the other locations ha ve many bicy cles, not that the other locations ar e “contingent on, ” or dependent on, the
bicycles. Nothing in the text suggests that the locations themselv es depend on the bicy cles for anything. Choice D is incorr ect
because it would not mak e sense in context t o sa y that some locations ar e “depleted of, ” or empty of, bicy cles while others ha ve
an insuﬃcient supply . The text describes situations in which bicy cles ha ve been r elocated such that ther e is a mismatch between
bicycle supply and user demand—the bicy cles ar e no longer at the locations wher e users want t o pick them up. This means that
some locations do not ha ve enough bicy cles, while other locations must ha ve many bicy cles, not be depleted of bicy cles.

Text 1
The Cr etaceous-P aleogene (K -Pg) mass extinction e vent is usually attributed solely t o an aster oid impact near Chicxulub, Mexico.
Some scientists ar gue that volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K -Pg event occurr ed relativ ely early in a long period of
eruption of the Deccan Traps r ange that initially pr oduced huge amounts of climate-altering gases.  These dissenters note that
other mass extinctions ha ve coincided with lar ge volcanic eruptions, while only the K -Pg event lines up with an aster oid strik e.
 
Text 2
In a 2020 study , Pincelli Hull and her colleagues analyz ed ocean cor e samples and modeled climate changes ar ound the K -Pg
event. The team concluded that Deccan Traps gases did aff ect global conditions prior t o the e vent, but that the climate r eturned t o
normal well befor e the extinctions began—extinctions that instead closely align with the Chicxulub impact.
Based on the texts, how would Hull’ s team (T ext 2) most lik ely respond t o the ar gument in the underlined por tion of Text 1?
A. By agr eeing that the Chicxulub impact changed the climate and that the Deccan Traps eruption caused the K -Pg event
B. By declaring that the changes in climate caused b y the Deccan Traps eruption wer en’t the main cause of the K -Pg event
C. By questioning why those scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps eruption
D. By asser ting that the Deccan Traps eruption had a mor e signiﬁcant eff ect on global conditions than those scientists claim
ID: 84dbd633  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull’ s team would most lik ely respond t o the ar gument in the underlined
portion of Text 1, which asser ts that v olcanic activity in the Deccan Traps r ange led t o changes in the climate and caused the K -Pg
mass extinction e vent. Accor ding t o Text 2, although Hull’ s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the
climate befor e the K -Pg event, the team determined that the climate had r eturned t o normal befor e mass extinctions began. This
ﬁnding and the obser vation that the K -Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub aster oid impact suggest that Hull’ s team
would lik ely dispute the claim in the underlined por tion of Text 1 and sa y that the climate changes caused b y the Deccan Traps
activity wer e not the main cause of the extinctions.
Choice A is incorr ect because Text 2 describes how Hull’ s team found that the climate had r ecovered fr om the changes br ought
about b y the Deccan Traps activity befor e the K -Pg event occurr ed, which suggests that Hull’ s team would disagr ee that the
Deccan Traps activity caused the K -Pg event. Additionally , the claim in the underlined por tion of Text 1 sa ys nothing about how the
Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull’ s team might belie ve that the impact did in fact change the climate, the y
could not be said t o agr ee with the claim in Text 1 on this point. Choice C is incorr ect because ther e is no indication in either text
that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity , so ther e is no r eason t o conclude that
Hull’ s team would question why the scientists r eferred to in Text 1 mak e such an assumption. Choice D is incorr ect because Text 2
describes how Hull’ s team found that the climate had r ecovered fr om the changes br ought about b y the Deccan Traps activity
befor e the K -Pg event occurr ed, which suggests that Hull’ s team would sa y that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring
effect on global conditions than the scientists r eferenced in Text 1 belie ve, not that the eff ect on global conditions was mor e
signiﬁcant than those scientists claim.

Choice B is the best answer because it accur ately describes the function of the underlined phr ase in the text as a whole.
Accor ding t o the text, adv ertisers wer e reluctant t o suppor t tele vision in its early da ys. The underlined phr ase then indicates that

Choice A is the best answer . “Suitable ” means “ appr opriate for a par ticular purpose. ” Since the text indicates that two of the best

Choice B is incorr ect. The text ne ver suggests that Tink er-Smith ’s choice was determined. That would imply that Tink er-Smith
initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing lik e that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorr ect. The

ID: 81a3a607  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the Three Sisters inter cropping system.
As used in this context, “intricate ” would mean made up of complexly r elated elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters
system, maiz e, squash, and beans form a “ web of r elations” in which the cr ops inter act in v arious wa ys. The text’ s description of
these inter actions—the bean vines gr owing on the maiz e stalks, the squash vines k eeping weeds awa y, and the beans adding
nutrients that the maiz e and squash use—pr ovides context suggesting that this “ web of r elations” is intricate.
Choice A is incorr ect because describing the r elationship among the cr ops in the Three Sisters system as “indecipher able, ” or
impossible t o compr ehend, would not mak e sense in context. Although the text pr esents the r elationship as complex, the text’ s
description of the r ole that each cr op pla ys mak es it clear that the r elationship is well underst ood, not indecipher able. Choice B is
incorr ect because the text discusses the pr actical beneﬁts that each plant in the Three Sisters system pr ovides t o other members
of the system, showing that the r elationship among the cr ops that mak e up the system is not “ ornamental, ” or mainly ser ving a
decor ative purpose. Choice C is incorr ect because describing the r elationship among the cr ops in the Three Sisters system as
“obscur e,” or unknown or poorly underst ood, would not mak e sense in context. Although the text pr esents the r elationship as
complex, the text’ s description of the r ole that each cr op pla ys mak es it clear that the r elationship is well underst ood, not obscur e.

The fact that ther e is no contempor ary evidence that the ﬁrst audience of Arriv al of the Train was alarmed has not st opped the

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it pr ovides a statement about the description of the ﬁrst showing of Arriv al of the Train in
Text 1 that, based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most lik ely agr ee with. Text 1 indicates that members of the audience,
unaccust omed t o the new medium of ﬁlm and belie ving that the y wer e looking at a r eal oncoming tr ain, allegedly r eacted t o the
ﬁlm with alarm. Text 1 then goes on t o treat this anecdote as a factual account of the ﬁlm ’s ﬁrst showing, interpr eting it as a
moment that mark ed a " major cultur al shift. " In contr ast, the author of Text 2 indicates that though the st ory of the ﬁlm ’s ﬁrst
showing has become " canonical, " or widely accepted, ther e is no contempor ary evidence t o suppor t the idea that the audience
reacted as Text 1 describes. Text 2 goes on t o explain that this factually questionable description lik ely persists because it
functions as a "founding myth " that r einfor ces a widespr ead belief in the pr ofoundly tr ansformativ e natur e of the inv ention of ﬁlm.
This indicates that the author of Text 2 would lik ely see the description in Text 1 as motiv ated primarily b y cultur al per ceptions
about ﬁlm ’s signiﬁcance r ather than b y documented hist orical facts.
Choice B is incorr ect because the author of Text 2 doesn ’t suggest that ﬁlm hist orians r egar d the view about ﬁlm ’s transformativ e
natur e as naïv e. On the contr ary, Text 2 states that the st ory of the ﬁrst showing of Arriv al of the Train has become " canonical, e ven
among ﬁlm hist orians, " indicating that hist orians br oadly accept this narr ative as a compelling illustr ation of ﬁlm ’s impact, not that
they regar d either the narr ative or the views it conv eys about the tr ansformativ e natur e of ﬁlm as naïv e. Text 2 r efers t o a "(naïv e)
‘befor e’" in cultur al hist ory, but this is describing how the myth itself char acteriz es pr e-ﬁlm audiences, not how hist orians r egar d
views about the tr ansformativ e natur e of ﬁlm. Choice C is incorr ect. While the author of Text 2 does indicate that the st ory of the

audiences befor e and after the inv ention of ﬁlm; it doesn ’t char acteriz e modern audiences v ersus ﬁlm hist orians. Choice D is

the accur acy of the audience ’s alleged r eaction; the author questions whether early audiences wer e alarmed at all, stating ther e is

work ed closely with W oolf t o create original co ver ar t for most of the no vels.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. rebellion
B. partnership
C. disco very
D. disagr eement
ID: 8d579825  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the co ver ar t of Vir ginia W oolf’s no vels. In
this context, “ partnership ” means collabor ation or joint effor t. The text states that W oolf’s sister V anessa Bell was a talented
painter and that Bell work ed with W oolf t o provide the co ver ar t for most of W oolf’s no vels. Thus, this context suggests that W oolf
and Bell pursued a cr eativ e par tnership in or der t o produce se veral of W oolf’s no vels.
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e is no indication that W oolf or Bell wer e under going a “r ebellion, ” or r evolt, against anything in
particular . Instead, the text focuses on how the y work ed together in some aspects of the pr oduction of W oolf’s no vels. Choice C is
incorr ect because ther e is nothing in the text t o indicate that W oolf or Bell made a “ disco very,” or encounter ed anything new for the
ﬁrst time as the y work ed together . The text suggests that W oolf had alr eady written her no vels and that Bell then assisted W oolf
with the co ver ar t for many of them. Choice D is incorr ect because the text implies that W oolf and Bell had a positiv e relationship.
Accor ding t o the text, the sisters “ work ed closely ” together t o produce the co ver ar t for many of W oolf’s no vels; the text doesn ’t
mention whether while working t ogether , Woolf and Bell had a “ disagr eement, ” or conﬂict.

ID: 85083d4d  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the ar t at the National Museum of the
American Indian. In this context, "homogenous" means uniform or highly similar . The text explains that the painters whose works
are included in this museum ’s collection emplo y an arr ay of ar tistic styles, both Nativ e and non-Nativ e, traditional and new . Giv en
this high degr ee of stylistic div ersity , it is a misconception that Nativ e art is uniform, or homogenous.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t consider whether Nativ e art is contr oversial, or causes disagr eement or discussion;
instead, the text discusses the stylistic div ersity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is
incorr ect. Although the text indicates that some of the ar tists whose work is r epresented in the collection of the National Museum
of the American Indian blend v arious ar tistic tr aditions int o highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primar y focus of the
text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Nativ e art is often mistak enly per ceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically
diverse. Choice C is incorr ect because the text ne ver implies that people mistak enly conceiv e of Nativ e art as theor etical, or
concerned with philosophical or abstr act issues; instead, the text’ s discussion of Nativ e art is fr amed ar ound this ar t’s stylistic
diversity v ersus the misconception of it as homogenous.

As used in the text, what does the wor d “endur e” most nearly mean?
A. Regr et
B. Persist
C. Tolerate
D. Encour age
ID: 3566120b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “ endur e” most nearly means t olerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon
discuss par ting, or sa ying goodb ye. Cecily r emarks on the deep pain of sa ying goodb ye to people whom one has only known
brieﬂy and then comments on the equanimity , or calm steadiness, one experiences when separ ated fr om old friends. The text sets
up an ir onic contr ast: one can easily t olerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but e ven a v ery shor t separ ation fr om a
new acquaintance is unbear able.
Choice A is incorr ect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates r egret, or a f eeling of sorr ow, with the absence of old
friends. Rather , the text sets up an ir onic contr ast between the f eeling of calm steadiness one f eels when separ ated fr om old
friends and the unbear able pain of being separ ated fr om new acquaintances. Choice B is incorr ect. Although in some contexts
“endur e” can mean persist, or pr oceed stubbornly , it doesn ’t ha ve that meaning in this context because what is being endur ed is
the absence of old friends. Wher eas one can persist despite  the absence of someone else, one can ’t persist the absence itself.
Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t conv ey that Cecily encour ages, or ur ges, old friends t o be absent. Although it ma y
be that Cecily pr efers new acquaintances t o friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her f eelings as a r esult of
others’ absences, not on her tr eatment of others.

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecr aft’s contact with

boulders on the aster oid’s sur face caused some unfor eseen pr oblems, OSIRIS-REx was able t o gather a sample t o return t o Ear th.
This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context “ attached” means connected or aﬃx ed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gather ed
pieces of 101955 Bennu t o bring t o Ear th; it doesn ’t suggest that the spacecr aft attached anything t o the aster oid. Choice C is

For decades, bluegr ass musicians ha ve debated whether their genr e should ex clude inﬂuences fr om mainstr eam genr es such as

Such “ purists, ” as the y are known, r egar d the r ecor dings of Bill Monr oe, which established the bluegr ass sound in the 1940s, as a
standar d against which the genr e should still be measur ed.
 
Text 2
Bluegr ass isn ’t simply an extension of folk tr aditions int o the er a of r ecor ded music. In r eality , Bill Monr oe cr eated the bluegr ass
sound in the 1940s b y combining Southern folk music with commer cial genr es that had arisen only a f ew decades befor e, such as
jazz and the blues. Since bluegr ass has alwa ys been a mix ed genr e, contempor ary bluegr ass musicians should not be forbidden

called for lighting pr actices that wer en’t possible until after the adv ent of electricity ar ound 1881. 
 
Text 2
Adolphe Appia was not an amateur in the pr actice of lighting. Instead, it is pr ecisely his exposur e to lighting techniques at the time
that contributed t o his theor y on the impor tance of light. When working as an appr entice for a lighting specialist in his y outh, Appia

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of a r elationship between the dodder plant
and its host plant. As used in this context, “ synchr onization ” means the act of things happening at the same time. The text
indicates that the dodder and its host plant ﬂower in unison and that this synchr onization occurs because the dodder mak es use
of a pr otein pr oduced b y the host shor tly befor e ﬂowering.
Choice B is incorr ect because r eferring t o “hibernation, ” or the state of being dormant or inactiv e, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context.
The text focuses on something the dodder plant activ ely engages in—making use of a pr otein and pr oducing ﬂowers. Choice C is
incorr ect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage t ogether in “ prediction, ” or the act of declaring or indicating
something in adv ance, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant mak e a
prediction about ﬂowering activity , the text suggests that the host pr oduces a pr otein as par t of its r egular ﬂowering pr ocess and
that the dodder then absorbs and uses that pr otein t o ﬂower at the same time. Choice D is incorr ect because r eferring t o
“moder ation, ” or the act of causing something t o become less intense or extr eme, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. Although the
text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a pr otein made b y its host plant, it doesn ’t suggest that the dodder lessens the

Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text "r eaching acr oss t o" most nearly means str etching t owar d. The text

Wilkins, sta ying wher e she is, holds out a big or ange t o her friend. This context suggests that when the text describes Mrs. Wilkins

ID: 1b5d4e3e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text
begins with a question: ha ve penguins alwa ys been unable t o ﬂy? The underlined sentence then pr esents an answer that has been
offered b y resear chers, indicating that Ther esa Cole and her team belie ve that penguins wer e once able t o ﬂy but lost that ability
long ago as the y began living in the sea. The text then describes the r esear ch that led t o that answer . Thus, the function of the
underlined sentence is t o provide an answer t o the question in the pr evious sentence.
Choice A is incorr ect because none of the terms used in the sentence that follows ar e deﬁned in the underlined sentence; no
deﬁnitions ar e giv en at all. Instead, the sentence pr esents Ther esa Cole and her team ’s answer t o the earlier question about
penguins’ ability t o ﬂy. Choice B is incorr ect because ther e is no contr adiction between the underlined sentence and the sentence
that follows since both conv ey that at some point penguins under went adaptations that limited their ability t o ﬂy and helped them
swim and liv e in the sea. Instead of contr adicting later information, the underlined sentence pr esents an answer t o the earlier
question about penguins’ ability t o ﬂy. Choice D is incorr ect because the question in the pr evious sentence is about penguins’
ability t o ﬂy and the underlined sentence pr esents Ther esa Cole and her team ’s answer t o that question based on their r esear ch
into penguin ﬂight, which is described in the r est of the text.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. a coincidence 
B. a reprie ve
C. an incident
D. an oddity
ID: dc234d74  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the dur ation of gamma r ay burst GRB
230307A. In this context, " an oddity " is something that is odd or unusual. The text explains that the burst lasted for 200 seconds
and that other bursts gener ated b y neutr on mer gers ha ve usually lasted f ewer than 2 seconds. In other wor ds, the dur ation of
gamma r ay burst GRB 230307A was unusual.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text focuses on a diff erence between the dur ation of gamma r ay burst GRB 230307A and the
typical dur ation of bursts caused b y neutr on mer gers, not " a coincidence, " or a point of corr espondence, between them; the text
indicates that GRB 230307A lasted much longer than what is typical of other bursts. Choice B is incorr ect. In this context, " a
reprie ve" would be either a tempor ary relief fr om something or a dela y of a punishment, neither of which would mak e sense as
something that the dur ation of a gamma r ay burst could pr ovide t o the burst itself. Choice C is incorr ect. Although it would mak e
sense t o refer to gamma r ay burst GRB 230307A itself as " an incident, " or a thing that occurr ed, the missing wor d describes the
duration of the burst, and it doesn ’t mak e much sense t o describe a length of time as an incident. F urther, the sentence
emphasiz es that the burst’ s dur ation was v ery unusual, not simply that the burst occurr ed.

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the contributions of the Sumerian
civilization. In this context, “intr oduced” means br ought int o practice or use. The text states that the ﬁrst r eference t o a se ven-da y
week appears in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh . The text pr esents this information about the se ven-da y week as an example of a
concept intr oduced b y the Sumerian civilization that persists int o present-da y civilizations. 
Choice A is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization “tr ansformed, ” or changed the natur e of,
concepts that persist int o present-da y civilizations. Instead, the text’ s presentation of a Sumerian liter ary work that contains the
ﬁrst description of the se ven-da y week is an example of the phenomenon described in the ﬁrst half of the sentence, suggesting
that the Sumerians inv ented many concepts that still persist. Choice C is incorr ect because the information that a Sumerian
literary work includes the ﬁrst description of the se ven-da y week suggests that Sumerian civilization ma y have originated the
seven-da y week and other concepts that persist int o present-da y civilizations, not that it “inherited” the concepts, or r eceiv ed them

ID: a3761c7e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of physicist Joseph W ebster ’s resear ch on
gravitational wa ves. In this context “foundational” means the basis on which something else de velops. The text indicates that
Webster ’s experiments in the 1960s and 1970s wer e earlier than, and “k ey” to, the work of later scientists in the ﬁeld; thus,
Webster ’s work was foundational t o the later scientists’ experiments and the e ventual detection of a gr avitational wa ve in 2015.  
Choice B is incorr ect because the text does not suggest that W ebster ’s work was supplementar y, or an additional element of an
existing, lar ger pr oject, but r ather it was “the basis for ” later experiments. Choice C is incorr ect because the text does not asser t
that W ebster ’s work was r epetitiv e, or inv olved doing something the same wa y many times. Rather , the text indicates that
Webster ’s work formed the basis for later inv estigations in the ﬁeld of gr avitational wa ve resear ch.  Choice D is incorr ect because

ID: c0e1b70a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. The narr ator asser ts that she
loves both her “ own” countr y (Japan) and her “ adopted countr y” (the United States) e ven though the two countries diff er “widely .”
She also indicates that, at ﬁrst, she would tr y to explain unfamiliar experiences that she had in the United States using the
standar ds ingr ained in her fr om gr owing up in Japan. Thus, the main purpose of the text is t o conv ey the narr ator’s experience of
obser ving and making sense of the diff erences between two cultur es she embr aces.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text mak es no r eference t o possible companions. Although the text does indicate that the
narrator sometimes used the cultur al framework she acquir ed gr owing up in Japan t o explain some experiences she ’s had, ther e is
no suggestion that this was in ser vice of making friends. And although “ no one seemed t o know” str ongly implies that the narr ator
has inter acted with other people in the United States, ther e is no indication that these conv ersations inv olved her discussing
Japanese cust oms. Choice C is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that the narr ator was hesitant t o ask questions. In
fact, the narr ator indicates that “ no one seemed t o know the origin ” of v arious cust oms, which pr ovides e vidence that, r ather than
being hesitant, she sought information fr om se veral people. Choice D is incorr ect because the text mak es no r eference t o the
physical distance between Japan and the United States. Although the narr ator indicates that the two countries diff er “widely ” and

ID: bbb77c84  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the fork f ern’s enormous genome. In this
context, " superseded" means surpassed or ex ceeded b y something else. The text establishes that this plant has "the lar gest
known " genome among eukar yotes and mentions "the high biological costs of extr emely lar ge genomes, " suggesting ther e are
natur al constr aints that mak e it biologically disadv antageous t o maintain such massiv e genetic material. This context suppor ts
the idea that it’ s unlik ely another or ganism will e volve an e ven lar ger genome that would r eplace this plant’ s recor d—that is, its
status as ha ving the lar gest genome is unlik ely to be superseded.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " protracted" would mean dr awn out o ver time or space, and the text focuses on the
recor d siz e of the New Caledonian fork f ern’s genome and the fact that extr emely lar ge genomes carr y "high biological costs. " This
information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome siz e ma y have been r eached and that the New Caledonian fork
fern’s genome is ther efore unlik ely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’ s unlik ely to be pr otracted. Choice C is incorr ect
because in this context, " curtailed" would mean cut shor t or r educed, and the text focuses on the r ecor d siz e of the New
Caledonian fork f ern’s genome and the fact that extr emely lar ge genomes carr y "high biological costs. " This information suggests
that the biological upper limit for genome siz e ma y have been r eached and that the New Caledonian fork f ern’s genome is
therefore unlik ely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’ s unlik ely to be cur tailed. Choice D is incorr ect because in this
context, " obviated" would mean made unnecessar y or r edundant, and the text focuses on the r ecor d siz e of the New Caledonian
fork f ern’s genome and the fact that extr emely lar ge genomes carr y "high biological costs. " This information suggests that the

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Helen Liu F ong’s architectur al designs. In
this context, “tr aditional” means conv entional. The text states that r ather than use “ standar d shapes and colors, ” Fong pursued

ID: 47904792  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the main purpose of the text. The text ﬁrst states that animals
mak e use of objects as t ools t o help them achie ve diff erent goals. The text then explains that although people used t o think only
primates use t ools, t ool use b y dolphins (aquatic mammals) and palm cockat oos (bir ds) has shown that primates ar e not the only
animals that use t ools. Thus, the main purpose of the text is t o argue that a v ariety of animals, not just primates, use t ools.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mention intelligence at all, focusing just on the idea that animals use t ools. F urther,
the text mentions one kind of bir d (palm cockat oos) only as an example of a non-primate that uses t ools and describes its use of

ID: b940952c  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of a pr ediction about a kilono va. In this
context, a "theor y" is an explanation that is consider ed scientiﬁcally acceptable. The text states that astr onomers pr edicted in the
1990s that a collision between a black hole and a neutr on star or between two neutr on stars could r elease a massiv e gamma r ay
burst called a kilono va, explaining that the y determined this possibility based on their extensiv e work with existing data and
simulations (" calculations and models"). In other wor ds, the pr ediction was a theor y—a well-suppor ted explanation—that, as the
text indicates, was later conﬁrmed with obser vations in 2017.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text indicates that it is the pr ediction made b y astr onomers in the 1990s that was conﬁrmed in
2017, and a pr ediction of an e vent isn ’t "evidence, " or pr oof, of that e vent’s existence, e ven when the pr ediction is based on
extensiv e study . Further, ther e would be no need for later conﬁrmation of something that was alr eady r ecogniz ed as e vidence.
Choice C is incorr ect because in this context, a " constant" is a situation or fact or that doesn ’t change. The text indicates that it is
the pr ediction made b y astr onomers in the 1990s that was conﬁrmed in 2017, and ther e is no r eason t o describe the pr ediction as
a constant because the text doesn ’t suggest that the pr ediction was completely unchanged o ver time—it addr esses only the
making of the pr ediction and its later conﬁrmation. Choice D is incorr ect because the text indicates that it is the pr ediction made
by astr onomers in the 1990s that was conﬁrmed in 2017; although a pr ediction might be informed b y an " experiment, " or a

ID: 570970cd  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text’ s overall por trayal of how
the women in Ohiy esa’s tribe har vested maple syrup. The text states that the women used an ax e to strik e the maple tr ees in or der
to ﬁnd out which ones would pr oduce sap. The underlined sentence compar es the tr ees t o people, with the sap described as the
trees’ “lif e-blood. ” Some of the tr ees ar e ready t o giv e out their sap, while others ar e unwilling t o do so. Using personiﬁcation, the
sentence pr ovides gr eater detail about the aspect of the maple tr ees—their potential t o giv e sap—that the women ar e evaluating.
Choice A is incorr ect because the personalities of the women ar e not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence
does mention “individual char acters, ” this r eference is not t o the women in the text but r ather t o the maple tr ees, which the
sentence compar es to people with individual char acter tr aits. Choice B is incorr ect because the underlined sentence focuses on
the tr ees’ willingness or r efusal t o yield sap, not on the beneﬁcial r elationship between the women and the tr ees. Additionally ,
although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe beneﬁt fr om the maple tr ees since the tr ees allow the women t o
harvest syrup, ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that the tr ees beneﬁt fr om this r elationship in turn. Choice C is incorr ect
because the underlined sentence is comparing maple tr ees t o humans, not addr essing the inﬂuence of the natur al envir onment on
how the actual humans in the text, the women, beha ve.

Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing " similarities with " means ha ving some r esemblance t o. The text
establishes a comparison between two gr oups of mammals, stating that although the y aren’t closely r elated, hedgehog tenr ecs
and true hedgehogs pla y similar r oles in their habitats, a cir cumstance that has r esulted in the independent de velopment of some
of the same physical tr aits. This context suppor ts the idea that hedgehog tenr ecs r esemble, or shar e basic similarities with, true
hedgehogs in some r espects.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that hedgehog tenr ecs ar e "examples of, " or r epresentativ e of, true
hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shar ed physical tr aits, the two gr oups of mammals ar en’t closely r elated; ther efore,
hedgehog tenr ecs can ’t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, " concerns about" would

that hedgehog tenr ecs shar e with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two gr oups of mammals, and
saying that the tr aits shar ed within one gr oup of mammals pr ovide e vidence of another gr oup of mammals wouldn ’t be an

In 2021, a team led b y Amir Sir aj hypothesiz ed that the Chicxulub impact or—the object that struck the Y ucatán P eninsula sixty-six
million y ears ago, pr ecipitating the mass extinction of the dinosaurs—was lik ely a member of the class of long-period comets. As
evidence, Sir aj cited the carbonaceous chondritic composition of samples fr om the Chicxulub impact cr ater as well as of samples
obtained fr om long-period comet Wild 2 in 2006.
 
Text 2
Although long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, aster oids ar e similarly rich in these materials. F urthermor e, some
aster oids ar e rich in iridium, as Natalia Ar temie va points out, wher eas long-period comets ar e not. Giv en the pr evalence of iridium
at the cr ater and, mor e broadly , in geological la yers deposited worldwide following the impact, Ar temie va argues that an aster oid

Based on the texts, how would Ar temie va likely respond t o Sir aj’s hypothesis, as pr esented in Text 1?
A. By insisting that it o verestimates how r epresentativ e Wild 2 is of long-period comets as a class
B. By ar guing that it does not account for the amount of iridium found in geological la yers dating t o the Chicxulub impact

ID: eae66bf9  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . Siraj’s hypothesis is that the Chicxulub impact or was a long-period comet. But Ar temie va points t o
the iridium found in the cr ater and in “ geological la yers that wer e deposited worldwide after the impact” as e vidence that it was
actually an aster oid, not a long-period comet.
Choice A is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that this is how Ar temie va would r espond t o Sir aj’s hypothesis. Text 2 ne ver discusses
whether Wild 2 is r epresentativ e of long-period comets in gener al. Rather , Text 2 pr esents Ar temie va’s argument that the Chicxulub
impact or was an aster oid, not a long-term comet. Choice C is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that this is how Ar temie va would r espond t o
Siraj’s hypothesis. Sir aj’s hypothesis doesn ’t mak e this connection: r ather , Siraj hypothesiz es that the Chicxulub impact or was a
long-term comet. Choice D is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that this is how Ar temie va would r espond t o Sir aj’s hypothesis. “Soil

ID: a1ff8ce3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of ar tworks that wer e produced for
exhibition on the internet. In this context, " defunct" means no longer existing or functioning. Accor ding t o the text, many ar tworks
that wer e produced in the mid-1990s t o the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet ha ve become inaccessible due t o their
reliance on cer tain softwar e. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim ’s Genesis , which r elied on softwar e that was discontinued in
2021. This context suppor ts the idea that the softwar e is defunct.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text indicates that viewing ar tworks pr oduced in the mid-1990s t o the early 2000s for exhibition
on the internet r equir es the use of softwar e. Ar tists gener ally want their works t o be seen b y many people, so it wouldn ’t mak e
sense for cr eators of internet ar t to requir e the use of softwar e that is " arcane, " or known or knowable t o only a f ew people.
Moreover, the text states that a pr ominent example of softwar e used t o view these ar tworks is Adobe Flash, which was
discontinued in 2021, meaning it’ s now defunct. Choice C is incorr ect because "ubiquit ous" would mean found e verywher e, which
wouldn ’t mak e sense in this context. The text indicates that the r eason why many ar tworks that wer e produced in the mid-1990s t o
the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet ha ve become inaccessible has t o do with the softwar e requir ed for viewing them.
Accor ding t o the text, one example of such softwar e is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’ s now defunct.
Choice D is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that the softwar e used t o view ar tworks pr oduced in the mid-1990s t o
the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is " extraneous, " or irr elevant. Instead, the text indicates that use of speciﬁc softwar e

One challenge faced b y resear chers studying global urbanization is that countries ma y deﬁne urban settlements diff erently . Many
countries deﬁne urban settlements based on the number of people living in them. Howe ver, countries do not all use the same
number; for example, Iceland uses a minimum population of 200, while the Netherlands uses 20,000. Other countries use a
combination of population and other fact ors. This v ariation mak es it diﬃcult for r esear chers t o compar e aspects of urbanization
in diff erent countries.
 
Text 2
Recently , a gr oup of six international or ganizations de veloped global deﬁnitions of common types of settlements. The gr oup

Choice D is the best answer because Text 2 pr esents a possible solution t o the pr oblem identiﬁed in Text 1—that is, how
disparities in the criteria used b y diff erent countries t o deﬁne urban settlements mak e it " diﬃcult for r esear chers t o compar e

urbanization: " global deﬁnitions of common types of settlements" and a " new measur e called the ‘ degr ee of urbanization ’" that
"allows r esear chers t o better understand global urbanization r ates. "
Choice A is incorr ect. Although Text 2 mentions " a group of six international or ganizations" that de veloped criteria and a measur e
related t o settlements and urbanization, no or ganization or institution is singled out t o per form fur ther r esear ch. Choice B is
incorr ect because both texts ar e about urbanization r esear ch and neither mentions any other ﬁelds of study . Choice C is incorr ect.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the K elmscott Pr ess’s books. In this
context, " manif est in " means e vident or appar ent fr om. The text states that the K elmscott Pr ess, which was cofounded b y William
Morris, pr oduced its books using pr eindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the
use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the cr eation of medie val manuscripts. This context
suggests that Morris’ s repudiation of industrialization is appar ent fr om, or manif est in, the methods and materials his company
emplo yed.
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that Morris’ s repudiation of industrialization is "insensible t o,"
or unawar e of or lacking per ception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the pr oduction of the
Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used t o produce the K elmscott editions ar e
evidence of Morris’ s repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorr ect because it would not mak e sense t o sa y that Morris’ s
repudiation of industrialization was " scrutiniz ed b y," or examined closely b y, the K elmscott editions’ use of handmade materials
and intricate ornamentation. Although cr eating the K elmscott editions ma y have inv olved examining the books closely , the text
does not mention this aspect of Morris’ s work, and in any case, the action of using cer tain materials t o create those editions
cannot scrutiniz e Morris’ s attitude t owar d industrialization. Choice D is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that Morris’ s

ID: 35fd0eb4  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the diﬃculty in naming a lar ge number of
minor planets. In this context, "insurmountable " means impossible t o overcome or t oo diﬃcult t o solv e. The text establishes that
coming up with distinct names for minor planets is alr eady a diﬃcult task that has become e ven mor e challenging because ther e
are now mor e than 500,000 known minor planets. The logical conclusion is that ﬁnding unique names for such a v ast number of
celestial objects has become vir tually impossible—or insurmountable—which explains why the majority of r ecently disco vered
minor planets r eceiv e only identiﬁcation numbers instead of pr oper names.
Choice B is incorr ect because "f easible " means possible t o do or achie ve, which would contr adict the logic of the text. The text
indicates that the task of naming minor planets has become mor e diﬃcult because of their lar ge number . The text then explains
that this is why most new disco veries r eceiv e only identiﬁcation numbers. If the task wer e feasible, ther e would be no r eason t o
abandon the pr actice of giving pr oper names t o minor planets in fa vor of using only numbers. Choice C is incorr ect because
"substantial" means consider able in siz e, amount, or impor tance. While the text does suggest that naming all minor planets would
be a signiﬁcant under taking, describing the task as substantial wouldn ’t logically explain why the naming pr actice has been lar gely
abandoned in fa vor of using only identiﬁcation numbers. The text suggests that the task has become vir tually impossible
(insurmountable), not mer ely lar ge or signiﬁcant. Choice D is incorr ect because "unnecessar y," which means not needed, would
suggest that giving pr oper names t o minor planets ser ves no purpose. Howe ver, the text doesn ’t question the v alue or purpose of
naming minor planets; r ather , it explains that the sheer number of disco veries has made the alr eady challenging naming task
nearly impossible t o complete. The text pr ovides an example of a named minor planet (1227 Ger anium), indicating that naming
has been consider ed wor thwhile but has become impr actical because of the v olume.

Impr essionist painters often focused on the interpla y of color and light in their works. As such, those Impr essionists who placed

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it pr esents the statement about the use of painted fr ames in Impr essionist painting that both
authors would be most lik ely to agr ee with. Text 1 discusses painter E dgar Degas’ s insistence that his works r emain in their
original painted fr ames, which contr asted with the gold fr ames that wer e typical of the P aris ar t scene at the time. The text then
argues that the pr eference of Degas and other F rench Impr essionist painters for color ful fr ames can lik ely be attributed t o their
desir e "to distinguish themselv es fr om what was consider ed conv entional at the time. " Text 2 also notes that Impr essionist
painters " placed their works in painted fr ames" but ar gues that the y probably did so for a pur ely aesthetic r eason: t o ensur e that
"the fr ame ’s color ...would harmoniz e with the colors or subjects in a painting. " Though diff ering on Impr essionist painters’ r ationale
for using painted fr ames, the authors of both texts would agr ee that many Impr essionist painters wer e intentional about the
frames the y selected for their works.
Choice A is incorr ect because neither text suggests that gold fr ames wer e consider ed desir able b y those pur chasing Impr essionist
works. Indeed, it can be inf erred fr om the fact that Impr essionist painters used painted fr ames that those who pur chased those
works wouldn ’t ha ve had a str ong pr eference for gold fr ames. Choice B is incorr ect because neither text suggests that
Impr essionist painters chose colors for their paintings based on planned fr ame colors. Indeed, Text 2 states that fr ame colors
were chosen t o "harmoniz e with the colors or subjects in a painting, " implying that the color scheme of paintings pr edated and
took pr ecedence o ver the choice of the colors of fr ames. Choice D is incorr ect because Text 1 pr esents Degas’ s preference for
painted fr ames as being typical of Impr essionist painters’ attitudes t owar d the fr aming of their works. Mor eover, although Text 2
doesn ’t speciﬁcally discuss Degas, it concurs with Text 1’ s asser tion that these painters pr eferred painted fr ames. Thus, both texts

Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, " arranged" most nearly means " organiz ed." The text states that a

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of gender r oles in Shak espear e’s comedies.
As used in this context, “ prescribed” would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the char acters in the comedies often
defy gender r oles that ar e “socially dictated” (e ven if most char acters do r eturn t o those r oles e ventually) and that scholars ha ve
been v ery inter ested in these acts of deﬁance. This context indicates that what the char acters ar e rebelling against ar e standar ds
of beha vior pr escribed b y the society of the time.  
Choice A is incorr ect because sa ying that expectations about gender wer e “interjected, ” or suddenly inser ted between other things,
wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. Ther e’s no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender r oles was inser ted between other things
or was an interruption in a lar ger discussion. Choice B is incorr ect because the text indicates that Shak espear e depicts char acters
rebelling against expectations about gender that ha ve been “ socially dictated, ” not expectations that society has “ committed, ” or

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Hegel’ s works. In this context, " opaque "

their inﬂuence and insight, noting that r eaders must " penetr ate Hegel’ s frustr atingly dense pr ose" to access his impor tant ideas.
This context clearly establishes that Hegel’ s writing is initially challenging t o compr ehend, or opaque.
Choice A is incorr ect because " authoritativ e" means inﬂuential or clearly accur ate. Hegel’ s works ma y be authoritativ e, but it
wouldn ’t mak e logical sense in context t o sa y that although his works seem authoritativ e, the y have been inﬂuential. Instead, the
text focuses on the fact that Hegel’ s works ar e challenging t o read, but that working thr ough the dense pr ose can be r ewar ding.

Text 1
Philosopher G.E. Moor e’s most inﬂuential work entails the concept of common sense. He asser ts that ther e are cer tain beliefs that
all people, including philosophers, know instinctiv ely to be true, whether or not the y profess other wise: among them, that the y have
bodies, or that the y exist in a world with other objects that ha ve thr ee dimensions. Moor e’s car eful work on common sense ma y
seem ob vious but was in fact gr oundbr eaking.
 
Text 2
External world sk epticism is a philosophical stance supposing that we cannot be sur e of the existence of anything outside our
own minds. During a lectur e, G.E. Moor e once off ered a pr oof r efuting this stance b y holding out his hands and sa ying, “Her e is
one hand, and her e is another .” Many philosophers r eﬂexiv ely reject this pr oof (Annalisa Coliv a called it “ an ob viously anno ying
failur e”) but ha ve found it a challenge t o articulate exactly why the pr oof fails.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 1 most lik ely respond t o proponents of the philosophical stance outlined in Text
2?
A. By agr eeing with those pr oponents that Moor e’s treatment of positions that contr adict his own is fundamentally unserious
B. By suggesting that an instinctiv e distaste for Moor e’s position is pr eventing external world sk eptics fr om constructing a
suﬃciently rigor ous r efutation of Moor e
C. By ar guing that if it is v alid t o asser t that some facts ar e true based on instinct, it is also v alid t o asser t that some pr oofs ar e
inadequate based on instinct
D. By pointing out that Moor e would asser t that external world sk epticism is at odds with other beliefs those pr oponents must
unavoidably hold
ID: 03080769  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . Accor ding t o the author of Text 1, Moor e’s deﬁnition of common sense—things we instinctiv ely know
are true—includes the belief that we all “ exist in a world with other objects. ” The author of Text 1 describes this notion as both
“obvious” and “ groundbr eaking. ”  So it’ s saf e to inf er that the author would obser ve that Moor e would r espond t o external world
skeptics b y arguing that since e veryone instinctiv ely knows that things exist outside of their own minds, then external world
skepticism must be wr ong.
Choice A is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that the author of Text 1 would r espond this wa y to external world sk eptics. If anything, the
author of Text 1 seems t o agr ee with Moor e. Choice B is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that the author of Text 1 would r espond this wa y
to external world sk eptics. The author of Text 1 ne ver mentions external world sk eptics dir ectly , let alone why the y have a har d
time r efuting Moor e’s position. Choice C is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that the author of Text 1 would r espond this wa y to external
world sk eptics. Text 1’ s presentation of Moor e’s concept of common sense only includes the idea that some facts ar e true based
on instinct—it doesn ’t mention the idea that some pr oofs ar e inadequate based on instinct.

D. neglects
ID: b0ea8c28  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the Sueño de F amilia  art exhibition. In this
context, “ spans” means extends acr oss or co vers. The text states that the exhibition explor es González’ s artistic heritage and
featur es ar twork b y her gr eat-gr andfather , grandmother , mother , and niece. This context conv eys the idea that the exhibition spans,
or extends acr oss, ﬁv e gener ations of González’ s family .
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that the exhibition “borr ows, ” or acquir es, ﬁv e gener ations of
González’ s family . The text indicates that the exhibition f eatur es ar twork b y family members fr om ﬁv e gener ations, not that the ﬁv e
gener ations themselv es ha ve been acquir ed for inclusion in the exhibition. Choice C is incorr ect because the text indicates that the
purpose of the exhibition is t o highlight ar twork, not t o “judge, ” or giv e an opinion on, ﬁv e gener ations of the ar tist’s family . Choice
D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that the exhibition “ neglects, ” or giv es little attention t o, ﬁv e gener ations of
González’ s family . On the contr ary, the text indicates that the exhibition is dedicated t o exploring González’ s artistic heritage and
therefore designed t o bring attention t o her family members and their ar twork.

Oh, deep delight t o watch the gladsome wa ves
Exultant leap upon the rugged r ocks;
Ever repulsed, y et ever rushing on—
Filled with a lif e that will not know def eat;
To see the glorious hues of sky and sea.
The distant snowy sails, glide spirit lik e,
Into an unknown world, t o feel the sweet
Enchantment of the sea thrill all the soul,
Clearing the clouded br ain, making the hear t
Leap jo yous as it own bright, singing wa ves!
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined por tion in the text as a whole?
A. It por trays the surr oundings as an imposing and intimidating scene.
B. It char acteriz es the sea ’s wa ves as a r elentless and enduring for ce.
C. It conv eys the speak er’s ambiv alence about the natur al world.
D. It draws a contr ast between the sea ’s wa ves and the speak er’s thoughts.
ID: 749f3334  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. The
text pr esents the speak er’s experience of viewing the sea. In the underlined por tion, the speak er focuses on the idea that the
waves hitting r ocks on the shor e are a r elentless and enduring for ce: the y are constantly pushed back (“ ever repulsed”) but alwa ys
return (“ ever rushing on ”), as though the y have an ener gy that can ’t be o vercome (“ a life that will not know def eat”).
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the underlined por tion char acteriz es the wa ves as a r elentless for ce (alwa ys “r epulsed” but still
“rushing on ” and ne ver being def eated), the speak er doesn ’t suggest that the surr oundings ar e intimidating. Instead, the speak er
presents the scene in a positiv e wa y, describing the “ deep delight” of the “ gladsome, ” or cheer ful, wa ves and f eeling “the hear t /
Leap jo yous” while viewing the sea. Choice C is incorr ect because the underlined por tion doesn ’t suggest that the speak er is
ambiv alent, or has mix ed feelings about, the natur al world. Instead, it pr esents a single view of one par t of the immediate
surroundings: the speak er char acteriz es the sea ’s wa ves as an unst oppable for ce, since the y are constantly pushed back but
alwa ys return (“ ever repulsed, y et ever rushing on ”). Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text later suggests the speak er’s view of
her own thoughts b y referring t o a “ clouded br ain” and a hear t that leaps jo yously , this r eference neither occurs within the
underlined por tion nor establishes a clear contr ast with the r elentless determination of the wa ves. The underlined por tion
addr esses only the speak er’s view of the wa ves and doesn ’t suggest what her own thoughts might be.

Choice A is the best answer . "Speculate " means "t o form a theor y or guess without any clear e vidence. " This mak es sense

ID: e5e7f264  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the r ole of the gener al st ore in US rur al
communities during the 1800s. In this context, " sour ce" means a place wher e something originates or is obtained. The text states
that people would shar e news while socializing at the gener al st ore. This context suppor ts the idea that the st ore ser ved as a
sour ce of information in rur al communities.
Choice B is incorr ect because "riv al" would mean competit or or opponent. The text doesn ’t indicate that the gener al st ore was a
rival of anything. Instead, the text describes the gener al st ore as a place that enabled the sharing of information within rur al
communities. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context, " condition " would mean state, cir cumstance, or r equir ement. Although
the text implies that visiting the st ore was helpful for acquiring information since people shar ed news ther e, it wouldn ’t mak e
sense t o sa y that the gener al st ore was a condition of information. Choice D is incorr ect because " waste " would mean something
that is unused, discar ded, or spent unnecessarily , which would not mak e sense in context. The text describes the gener al st ore as

Like the work of Ralph Ellison befor e her , Toni Morrison ’s no vels f eatur e scenes in which char acters deliv er sermons of such length
and v erbal dexterity that for a time, the text ex changes the formal par ameters of ﬁction for those of or al liter ature. Giv en the many
other echoes of Ellison in Morrison ’s no vels, both in structur e and pr ose style, these scenes suggest Ellison ’s dir ect inﬂuence on
Morrison.
Text 2
In their destabilizing eff ect on liter ary form, the sermons in Morrison ’s works r ecall those in Ellison ’s. Yet liter ature by Black
Americans abounds in moments wher e interpolated speech er odes the division between or al and written forms that liter ature in
English has tr aditionally obser ved. Morrison ’s use of the sermon is attributable not only t o the inﬂuence of Ellison but also t o a
community-wide str ategy of r esistance t o externally imposed liter ary conv entions.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most lik ely char acteriz e the underlined claim in Text 1?
A. As failing t o consider Ellison ’s and Morrison ’s equiv alent uses of the sermon within the wider cultur al context in which the y
wrote
B. As misunderstanding the function of sermons in no vels b y Black American writers other than Ellison and Morrison
C. As disr egar ding points of structur al and stylistic div ergence between the works of Ellison and those of Morrison

ID: e4e2aeb3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The author of Text 2 ar gues that Morrison ’s use of the sermon is not only inﬂuenced b y Ellison, but
also b y a “community-wide str ategy of r esistance ” to liter ary conv entions pr acticed b y Black American authors. Ellison, Text 2
alleges, is only one of many inﬂuences on Morrison.
Choice B is incorr ect. Neither text speciﬁcally mentions sermons in works b y authors other than Morrison or Ellison, only a
tendency t owar ds er oding “the division between or al and written forms” among Black American writers. Choice C is incorr ect.
Both texts describe similarities between the works of Ellison and Morrison, and neither points out instances of div ergence. Text 2
simply suggests that Morrison was inﬂuenced b y mor e than just Ellison. Choice D is incorr ect. While Text 2 does discuss
Morrison ’s resistance t o cer tain liter ary conv entions, it’ s unclear what it would mean for the underlined claim t o be “indebted” t o

ID: 0d402146  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of tr aﬃc signals. As used in this context,
“featur ed” means had as a char acteristic or par t. The text indicates that although US tr aﬃc signals ha ve lights of thr ee diff erent
colors (r ed, y ellow , and gr een), this wasn ’t the case until the 1920s, when the thr ee-light signal was ﬁrst de veloped. Befor e then, the
text suggests, tr aﬃc signals had f ewer lights (as indicated b y the wor d “only” in the second sentence). This context suppor ts the
idea that befor e the 1920s, tr aﬃc signals f eatur ed only r ed and gr een lights.
Choice A is incorr ect because “ avoided” means k ept awa y from someone or something or pr evented something fr om occurring,
neither of which would mak e sense in context. The text doesn ’t discuss k eeping awa y from someone or something but instead
focuses on what US tr aﬃc signals look lik e. The text states that the y didn ’t ha ve lights of thr ee diff erent colors until the thr ee-light
signal was de veloped in the 1920s. Choice C is incorr ect because “ appr eciated” means admir ed or incr eased in v alue, neither of
which would mak e sense in context. The text focuses solely on the fact that US tr aﬃc signals ha ve contained lights of thr ee colors
only since the thr ee-light signal was de veloped in the 1920s. The text doesn ’t mention how this char acteristic or tr aﬃc signals in

objects and ther efore unable t o admir e or incr ease the v alue of something. Choice D is incorr ect because “ disregar ded” means

ID: e5da61f1  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text, which is t o explain diff erent wa ys
in which Julius was helpful. The text begins with the narr ator stating that Julius was v ery helpful t o him and his wif e when the y
moved to their new r esidence. The narr ator then pr ovides a list of examples t o illustr ate Julius’ s helpfulness. F or instance, the
narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood’ s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in na vigating them, and
that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text’ s many examples of Julius’ s usefulness r einfor ce just how helpful he
was and in how many diff erent wa ys.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t por tray either the narr ator’s or his wif e’s reaction t o their new home. Rather , the text
focuses on how Julius was useful t o the narr ator and his wif e in their new home. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text states
that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of se veral suppor ting details that illustr ate how helpful Julius was.
Moreover, the text mer ely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn ’t provide an example of that knowledge.
Choice C is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest the fr equency with which the narr ator and Julius hunted and
ﬁshed t ogether . In fact, it’ s unclear fr om the text whether the narr ator and Julius hunted and ﬁshed t ogether at all. The text mer ely

ID: ac5bf490  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined por tion in the text. The underlined
portion (" which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for ") dir ectly expr esses Gr ande ’s unhappiness
about her sister ’s diminished inter est in her Barbie doll. The underlined text speciﬁcally identiﬁes that Gr ande f eels sad and
explains why Mago ’s disinter est par ticularly aff ects her—because it was the one r are instance wher e her older sister had envied
her, rather than the r everse.
Choice B is incorr ect because the underlined por tion expr esses sadness, not anger . Although ther e is some corr espondence
between the emotions anger and envy and the text does indicate that Gr ande usually envies her sister , the underlined por tion
states that Gr ande f eels sad about Mago ’s disinter est in Gr ande ’s Barbie, not angr y about Mago ’s refusal t o spend time with her .
Choice C is incorr ect. While the ﬁrst par t of the sentence that contains the underlined por tion indicates that Mago has pr eviously
taken an inter est in Gr ande ’s Barbie, implying that the sisters ma y regularly ha ve pla yed with the Barbie t ogether in the past, the
underlined por tion doesn ’t provide an example of this. The underlined por tion instead explains why Mago ’s recently de veloped
disinter est in the Barbie saddens Gr ande. Choice D is incorr ect because neither the underlined por tion nor the text as a whole
explains why Mago is unwilling t o pla y with Gr ande. Rather than addr essing Mago ’s motiv ation or r easoning, the underlined por tion
describes Gr ande ’s emotional r eaction t o Mago ’s disinter est in Gr ande ’s Barbie and explains why this lack of inter est matters t o

Virginia W oolf’s 1928 no vel Orlando is an oddity within her body of work. Her other major no vels consist mainly of scenes of
everyday life and describe their char acters’ interior states in gr eat detail, wher eas Orlando propels itself thr ough a series of
fantastical e vents and considers its char acters’ psy chology mor e superﬁcially . Woolf herself sometimes r egar ded the no vel as a
minor work, e ven admitting once that she “began it as a jok e.”
 
Text 2
Like Woolf’s other gr eat no vels, Orlando portrays how people ’s memories inform their experience of the pr esent. Lik e those works,
it examines how people na vigate social inter actions shaped b y gender and social class. Though it is lighter in t one—mor e
enter taining, e ven—this liter ary “jok e” nonetheless engages seriously with the themes that motiv ated the four or ﬁv e other no vels

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most lik ely respond t o the assessment of Orlando presented in Text 1?
A. By conceding that W oolf’s talents wer e best suited t o serious no vels but asser ting that the humor in Orlando is often eff ectiv e

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it r eﬂects how the author of Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o the assessment of Orlando
in Text 1. Both authors agr ee that Orlando is unusual for W oolf: Text 1 states that the no vel examines its char acters’ psy chologies
more superﬁcially than W oolf’s other no vels do, and Text 2 describes it as being lighter in t one. Howe ver, while Text 1 calls Orlando
an “oddity ” and mentions that W oolf “began it as a jok e,” Text 2 asser ts that Orlando engages the same themes as W oolf’s other
great no vels. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most lik ely accept that Orlando differs fr om W oolf’s other no vels but would also
insist on its impor tance in the context of W oolf’s work as a writer .
Choice A is incorr ect. Text 2 does suggest that the humor in Orlando is eff ectiv e. Howe ver, ther e’s nothing in Text 2 t o suggest that
the author would agr ee that W oolf’s talents wer e best suited t o serious no vels. Rather , the author of Text 2 compar es Orlando
favorably t o other no vels b y Woolf that ar e implied t o be dark er in t one. Choice B is incorr ect because the author of Text 2 does not
indicate that Orlando is less impr essiv e than W oolf’s other no vels, but instead points out that it engages the same themes as other

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s description of effor ts to explain the existence of

explanation is dir ect and uncomplicated. The text asser ts that since it should be “ nearly impossible ” for planets t o form in binar y
star systems, it’ s “not surprising” that ther e isn ’t a str aightfor ward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of US for est land classiﬁcations. In this

Choice A is incorr ect because the text states that ther e is often dispute among for est r esear chers about classiﬁcations of US
forest land as either matur e or old gr owth, which dir ectly indicates that when it comes t o these categories, ther e is much
"deliber ation, " or discussion and consider ation, not little deliber ation. Choice B is incorr ect because the text indicates that ther e is

ID: 8a47383f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the purpose of the National Heritage
Fellowship. In this context, "r ecogniz e" means acknowledge or honor someone oﬃcially for their achie vements. The text states
that the f ellowship was cr eated for " exceptional folk and tr aditional ar tists. " It then pr ovides an example of one r ecipient of the
fellowship, cir cus aerialist Dolly Jacobs, who was giv en the f ellowship "t o celebr ate her lif etime contributions t o the ar ts." The fact
that the f ellowship is giv en to celebr ate ex ceptional ar tists for their achie vements ther efore suggests that its purpose is t o publicly
honor , or r ecogniz e, them.
Choice A is incorr ect because " startle" would mean alarm or surprise, and ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that Jacobs and
other ar tists who r eceiv ed the National Heritage F ellowship didn ’t expect t o receiv e it or wer e alarmed b y it. It ther efore wouldn ’t
mak e sense t o sa y the f ellowship was cr eated t o publicly alarm or surprise ex ceptional ar tists. Choice C is incorr ect because in
this context, "familiariz e" would mean mak e known or familiar , but the text giv es no indication that Jacobs or other r ecipients of
the National Heritage F ellowship wer e unknown or unfamiliar befor e receiving the f ellowship or that the f ellowship was intended
to mak e them familiar t o the public. In fact, the text describes r ecipients as " exceptional" and notes that Jacobs r eceiv ed the
awar d "to celebr ate her lif etime contributions t o the ar ts," both of which suggest that Jacobs and other r ecipients wer e alr eady
well known in the ar ts world. Choice D is incorr ect because " conv ey" would mean either tr anspor t or communicate something,
neither of which would be logical in this context. The f ellowship doesn ’t transpor t artists, and though the pr ocess of awar ding the
fellowship might communicate something about the ar tists t o the gener al public, it would be illogical t o state that the f ellowship

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the ar t installation Anthem . In this
context, “inv entiv e” means char acteriz ed b y inv ention and cr eativity . The text explains that critics’ r esponses t o the installation
involved pr aise for Tsang’ s creativ e transformation of a space int o a dynamic exhibit with huge images and lots of sound. This
context conv eys that the critics found the piece par ticularly cr eativ e.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that critics pr aised the installation for being dynamic and including huge images

Choice C is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that critics found the installation “inexplicable, ” or incapable of being

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of r esear ch on income inequality in the

shor tcoming in the r esear ch: a " myopic focus on a f ew countries" despite claims of " global r elevance. " The text then explains that

the idea that with these new data, r esear chers would be able t o reduce, or mitigate, the identiﬁed shor tcoming b y incorpor ating a

Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " presuppose " would mean t o assume in adv ance that something is true, and it
wouldn ’t mak e logical sense t o sa y that r esear chers later assumed as true in adv ance a shor tcoming the y had alr eady

indicates that r esear chers did something about the shor tcoming that char acteriz ed resear ch on income inequality in the 2010s—
limited geogr aphic scope—after the y gained access t o new data fr om pr eviously ex cluded r egions. Categorizing a shor tcoming

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it r eﬂects how the author of Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o Text 1 based on the
information pr ovided. Text 1 discusses the disco very of a r egener ation-link ed gene, EGR, in both thr ee-banded panther worms
(which ar e capable of full r egener ation) and humans (who ha ve relativ ely limited r egener ation abilities). Text 1 char acteriz es this
disco very as “ especially pr omising” and a sign of “ exciting pr ogress” in understanding human r egener ation. The author of Text 2,
on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that r epor ted the EGR ﬁnding pointed out that while EGR’ s function in humans
isn’t yet known, it’ s likely v ery diff erent fr om its function in panther worms. Ther efore, the author of Text 2 would most lik ely sa y
that Text 1’ s enthusiasm about the EGR disco very is o verly optimistic giv en Sriv asta va’s team ’s obser vations about EGR in
humans.
Choice A is incorr ect because the author of Text 2 explains that Sriv asta va and her team explicitly r epor ted that the y haven’t yet
identiﬁed how EGR functions in humans; ther efore, the author of Text 2 wouldn ’t say that Text 1’ s excitement is r easonable for the
stated r eason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would lik ely char acteriz e Text 1’ s excitement as pr ematur e and o verly optimistic.
Choice C is incorr ect because Text 1 does tr eat Sriv asta va’s team ’s ﬁndings with enthusiasm; it describes the disco very of EGR in
both thr ee-banded panther worms and humans as pr omising and ex citing. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 t o sa y that
because most others tr eat the disco very with enthusiasm, Text 1’ s enthusiastic char acterization of the disco very is unexpected.
Choice D is incorr ect because Text 1 isn ’t at all dismissiv e of Sriv asta va’s team ’s ﬁndings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the
EGR disco very, char acterizing it as pr omising and ex citing. Ther e’s nothing in Text 2 t o suggest that the author of Text 2 would sa y

Choice B is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The
underlined sentence explains that contr ary to what se veral studies would suggest, r ecent E uropean go vernments suff ered
elect orally after the launch of ﬁscal austerity pr ograms. The text goes on t o indicate that the r esear chers gener ated their ﬁndings

Choice A is incorr ect because the underlined sentence doesn ’t indicate that the discr epancy described in the text is between

the outcome of r ecent e vents is contr ary to what would be expected based on the ﬁndings of se veral studies. Additionally , ther e is
nothing in the text t o suggest that the studies mentioned did not use r eal-world data; instead, the text indicates that the data used

Because liter acy in Nahuatl script, the writing system of the A ztec Empir e, was lost after Spain inv aded centr al Mexico in the
1500s, it is unclear exactly how meaning was encoded in the script’ s symbols. Although many scholars had assumed that the
symbols signiﬁed entir e wor ds, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theoriz ed in 2008 that the y signiﬁed units of language smaller than
words: individual syllables.
 
Text 2
The gr owing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either wor ds or syllables,
depending on syntax and content at any giv en site within a text. F or example, the symbol signifying the wor d huipil  (blouse) in
some contexts could signify the syllable “ pil” in others, as in the place name “Chipiltepec. ” Thus, for the A ztecs, r eading r equir ed a
determination of how such symbols functioned each time the y appear ed in a text.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most lik ely char acteriz e Lacadena ’s theor y, as described in Text 1?
A. By pr aising the theor y for r ecognizing that the script’ s symbols could r epresent entir e wor ds
B. By ar guing that the theor y is o verly inﬂuenced b y the work of earlier scholars

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . Lacadena ’s theor y is that Nahuatl script symbols signiﬁed syllables, but the consensus described in
Text 2 is that the y can signify either symbols or full wor ds, depending on the context. So the author of Text 2 would lik ely consider
Lacadena ’s theor y too simplistic: it’ s missing the impor tance of the context in determining the meaning of a symbol.
Choice A is incorr ect. This conﬂicts with Text 1’ s description of Lacadena ’s theor y. Lacadena ’s theor y is that Nahuatl script
symbols signiﬁed syllables. Choice B is incorr ect. This conﬂicts with Text 1’ s description of Lacadena ’s theor y. Text 1 states that
Lacadena ’s theor y diff ered fr om what earlier scholars belie ved. Choice C is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that this is how the author of

Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it accur ately describes the o verall structur e of the text. The text begins b y pointing out an
obstacle t o obser ving the astr onomical phenomenon of the NCP: the NCP is visible only at night. The text then indicates that,
inspir ed b y the ability of some insects and bir ds to na vigate using visualizations of polariz ed sunlight, r esear chers de vised a wa y
to locate the NCP during da ylight. The text then indicates that the r esear chers mimick ed the insects’ and bir ds’ polariz ed-light
visualization capabilities using a polarimetric camer a. Thus, the text notes an obstacle t o obser ving an astr onomical phenomenon,
mentions a na vigational ability of cer tain animals that inspir ed a solution t o that obstacle, and then explains how r esear chers used
an optical de vice t o mimic that ability .
Choice A is incorr ect. Although it’ s reasonable t o conjectur e that humans ha ve used the NCP for na vigation, the text doesn ’t
indicate this is the case, let alone that the NCP is r elevant t o a majority of na vigational t ools. F urthermor e, the text doesn ’t state
that r esear chers disco vered that insects and bir ds na vigate without the NCP; r ather , it indicates that it’ s known that some animals
navigate b y using skylight polarization t o locate the NCP during the da y and that this knowledge inspir ed the method the
resear chers de vised. Choice B is incorr ect. Although it’ s reasonable t o conjectur e that humans ha ve used the NCP for na vigation,
the text doesn ’t state that this is the case. F urthermor e, the text discusses how some animals’ use of na vigational str ategies
based on the same celestial occurr ence ser ved as the inspir ation for the r esear chers’ polariz ed-light appr oach, not as the basis for
a comparison of the r elativ e eff ectiv eness of animal and human methods of na vigation. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text
implies that humans ha ve typically been able t o locate the NCP visually at night and indicates that some animals use the NCP t o
navigate, the text doesn ’t state that humans use the NCP for na vigation. The text ther efore doesn ’t emphasiz e a diff erence
between how humans and animals use the NCP for this purpose. F urthermor e, the text doesn ’t suggest that existing na vigational

Aster oid 6478 Gault has experienced intermittent mass loss since at least 2013, but in contr ast t o some other aster oids with
repeated mass-loss episodes, 6478 Gault has not lost mass at its perihelion (the closest point of its orbit t o the Sun), and thus the
loss is not attributable t o solar ener gy–driv en ice v aporization. And as Jane X. L uu et al. point out, the singular natur e of impact
ejection mak es it untenable as an account of multiple loss episodes of similar dur ation o ver se veral years. Instead, L uu et al. ar e
likely corr ect that 6478 Gault is shedding mass due t o rotational instability .
Which choice best describes the o verall structur e of the text?
A. It presents a scientiﬁc obser vation, describes a contr ast between that obser vation and other obser vations, and then explains
why those other obser vations should not be consider ed cr edible.  
B. It describes an astr onomical ﬁnding, discusses competing theories about that ﬁnding that the author r egar ds as ﬂawed, and
then describes new e vidence that suppor ts an alternativ e theor y.
C. It intr oduces a natur al phenomenon, r efutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then pr esents a thir d

ID: 6ae393f7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the o verall structur e of the text. The text begins b y intr oducing
the natur al phenomenon of intermittent mass loss with r egar d to Aster oid 6478 Gault and notes that it curiously has not lost mass
at its perihelion lik e other aster oids typically do. The text then r efutes " solar ener gy–driv en ice v aporization " and "the singular
natur e of impact ejection " as two possible explanations for Aster oid 6478 Gault’ s intermittent mass loss. Finally , the text pr esents
Luu et al. ’s explanation that "6478 Gault is shedding mass due t o rotational instability ," which the author sa ys is "lik ely corr ect."
Thus, the o verall structur e of the text is that it intr oduces a natur al phenomenon, r efutes two potential explanations for that
phenomenon, and then pr esents a thir d explanation for that phenomenon that the author r egar ds as plausible.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t distinguish between multiple obser vations. It focuses on the single obser vation that
Aster oid 6478 Gault is losing mass and e valuates multiple explanations for the phenomenon. The text also asser ts that L uu et al. ’s
explanation is cr edible and "lik ely corr ect." Choice B is incorr ect because the text describes a natur al phenomenon, not a speciﬁc
astronomical ﬁnding. In addition, although the text does note ﬂawed r easons for Aster oid 6478 Gault’ s intermittent mass loss, it
doesn ’t mention that Aster oid 6478 Gault’ s intermittent mass loss is based on new e vidence. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the
text does e valuate explanations for the cause of Aster oid 6478 Gault’ s intermittent mass loss, the text also asser ts that L uu et al. ’s

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . An " anomaly " is something that de viates fr om norms or expectations. In this case, the elkhorn cor al is
an anomaly because it can pass on somatic mutations, wher eas most other animals can ’t.
Choice A is incorr ect. A "hypothesis" is " a theor y about something, " but no theories ar e provided about elkhorn cor al in this text,
just facts. Choice B is incorr ect. " Aﬃnity " represents " an inclination or liking t owar d something. " As genetic mutations tend t o
occur without any conscious effor t, you can ’t really ha ve an inclination t owar d passing on somatic mutations. Choice D is
incorr ect. "Corr obor ation " means " evidence t o suppor t or pr ove something. " Because elkhorn cor al do the opposite of what most

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion about K ouchaki and colleagues’ r esear ch

to Kouchaki and colleagues’ r esear ch, people who work ed on har d tasks ﬁrst wer e “more skilled and pr oductiv e” than those who
did easy tasks ﬁrst. This context conv eys the idea that despite their sense of accomplishment, the people who chose t o do the

Choice A is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that work ers who do easy tasks ﬁrst ar e less “ secr etive,” or

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text’ s discussion about genes r elated t o hibernation. In this context,
“dormant” means inactiv e. The text explains that the same genes that enable cer tain nonhuman mammal species t o hibernate
during the winter b y altering their bodily pr ocesses ar e also found in our species but ha ve “essentially no eff ect” on humans’ bodily

Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, “ decisiv e” means has the power t o aff ect the outcome of something, but the text
states that genes r elated t o hibernation ar e instead inactiv e in humans—that is, the genes don ’t aff ect humans’ bodily pr ocesses,
although the y are present in their bodies. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, “lacking” means missing, but the text
states that the genes ar e present in humans, though inactiv e. Choice C is incorr ect because “v ariable ” means char acteriz ed b y the

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Ar turo A. Schombur g’s collection. In this
context, the phr ase “ depended on ” means r elied on. The text explains that Schombur g, wanting t o preser ve “books, ar t, and other
materials” cr eated b y peoples of African descent fr om ar ound the world, built a lar ge collection of these objects. The text also
states that in or der t o obtain these items, Schombur g ask ed friends and colleagues who wer e traveling internationally t o bring
them back for him. This implies that he wouldn ’t ha ve been able t o create his collection without help. Thus, the context suppor ts
the idea that Schombur g relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues t o build his collection.
Choice A is incorr ect because “ admir ed” means r espected and appr oved of. Although it’ s reasonable t o expect that Schombur g
respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn ’t discuss any such aspect of their r elationships. The text focuses instead on
what Schombur g ask ed his friends and colleagues t o do t o help build his collection. Choice B is incorr ect because “ disagr eed with ”
means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schombur g and his friends or colleagues held opposing

preser ving objects of impor tance for Black hist ory and cultur e by bringing him such objects fr om ar ound the world. Choice C is

When companies in the same industr y propose mer ging with one another , they often claim that the mer ger will beneﬁt consumers
by incr easing eﬃciency and ther efore lowering prices. E conomist Ying F an inv estigated this notion in the context of the United
States newspaper mark et. She modeled a hypothetical mer ger of Minneapolis-ar ea newspapers and found that subscription
prices would rise following a mer ger.
 
Text 2
Economists Dario F ocar elli and F abio P anetta ha ve argued that r esear ch on the eff ect of mer gers on prices has focused
excessiv ely on shor t-term eff ects, which tend t o be adv erse for consumers. Using the case of consumer banking in Italy , they
show that o ver the long term (se veral years, in their study), the eﬃciency gains r ealiz ed b y mer ged companies do r esult in

D. They would claim that mer gers ha ve a diff erent eff ect on consumer prices in the newspaper industr y than in most other

ID: f0ae0da3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because, based on the information pr esented in the texts, it r epresents how F ocar elli and P anetta
would most lik ely respond t o Fan’s ﬁndings. Text 1 indicates that F an found that a newspaper mer ger would r esult in a rise in
subscription prices. This rise wouldn ’t beneﬁt cust omers, who would ha ve to pa y mor e for news after a mer ger. Text 2 pr esents
Focar elli and P anetta ’s argument that mer ger r esear ch tends t o focus t oo much on what happens immediately after the mer ger.
Text 2 goes on t o describe their ﬁnding that mer gers can be economically beneﬁcial for consumers o ver the long term. This
suggests that F ocar elli and P anetta would encour age F an to inv estigate the long-term eff ect of the hypothetical newspaper
merger on subscription prices.
Choice A is incorr ect because Text 2 doesn ’t indicate that F ocar elli and P anetta connect the eff ects of mer gers t o speciﬁc
locations. Instead, F ocar elli and P anetta focus on the length of time o ver which the eff ects of mer gers should be e valuated.
Choice B is incorr ect because Text 2 indicates that F ocar elli and P anetta found that mer ged companies experience " eﬃciency
gains" o ver the long term, meaning that their expenses go down r elativ e to their output, not that their expenses incr ease. Choice D
is incorr ect because ther e’s no indication in Text 2 that F ocar elli and P anetta belie ve that the newspaper industr y is diff erent fr om
any other industr y when it comes t o the eff ects of mer gers. Although their own r esear ch was about consumer banking, Text 2

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole.
The ﬁrst sentence of the text establishes that scientists didn ’t know much about the ocean ﬂoor in the 1950s. The second
sentence, which is underlined, describes what many scientists thought at the time—that the ocean ﬂoor was mostly ﬂat. The
remainder of the text establishes that the ocean ﬂoor is far fr om ﬂat, citing r esear ch conducted b y Marie Tharp and Bruce Heez en.
Thus, the purpose of the underlined sentence is t o identify a scientiﬁc belief that Tharp and Heez en showed t o be wr ong.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although Tharp and Heez en’s work with sonar data in the A tlantic Ocean is mentioned later in the text, the
underlined sentence doesn ’t describe the design of their experiment. Instead, it identiﬁes a belief held b y scientists that Tharp and

scientists in the 1950s; nowher e does the text mention a disagr eement between Tharp and Heez en, whom the text describes as
resear ch par tners working t ogether t o map the ocean ﬂoor . Choice D is incorr ect because the underlined sentence doesn ’t present

Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole.
The ﬁrst sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied gr owth rings t o obtain information about the ancient oak planks
found during a construction pr oject in Rome. The next sentence pr esents what the r esear chers learned: the wood fr om the planks
came fr om F rance ’s Jur a region, which is far fr om Rome. The underlined sentence then pr esents the implications of the ﬁndings
about the planks: the wood must ha ve been br ought t o Rome b y boat, a diﬃcult task that suggests Roman tr ade r outes wer e

Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks wer e used in the construction of a

D. possessions
ID: d8d33cc5  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the early British postal system. In this
context, "r eforms" most nearly means attempts at impr oving something. The text indicates that the pa y-upon-deliv ery postage
method led t o fee avoidance on the par t of r ecipients. It then sa ys that action was tak en to impr ove the postal system, giving
examples such as the mo ve to ha ving the sender pa y and aﬃxing stamps t o indicate pa yment had been r eceiv ed. These r epresent
revisions t o the system intended t o impr ove its functioning; ther efore, "reforms" most logically completes the text.
Choice A is incorr ect. In this context, "inv estigations" most nearly means attempts t o understand something. And although it is
plausible that an attempt t o impr ove the postal system would inv olve inv estigations, nothing in the text pr ovides a logical basis for
understanding the example of changes lik e aﬃxing stamps t o letters as an inv estigation. Choice B is incorr ect. In this context,
"expansions" most nearly means additions t o something. Although the text indicates that some new policies wer e adopted,
nothing in the text suggests that the o verall number of policies incr eased, which expansions would seem t o entail. Choice D is
incorr ect. In this context, " possessions" most nearly means items of personal pr oper ty or things that other wise belong t o, or ar e
part of, something. The text pr ovides no logical context for understanding changes lik e aﬃxing stamps t o letters as possessions.

ID: 79fe7550  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Jung and her team ’s study of acts of
kindness. In this context, “foster ” means encour age or pr omote the de velopment of. The text indicates that Jung and her team
found that seeing a helpful (or pr osocial) act mak es a b ystander mor e likely to help someone else, which can in turn inspir e
additional people t o help others. That is, the team showed that single acts of kindness can foster additional pr osocial acts acr oss
a group.
Choice A is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness “r equir e,” or
depend on or mak e obligat ory, broader pr osocial (or helpful) beha vior acr oss a gr oup. Ther e’s no suggestion in the text that
individual acts of kindness can only occur if other pr osocial acts ha ve alr eady occurr ed, and the text indicates only that an act of
kindness can inspir e additional helpful acts, not that it necessarily will do so. Choice B is incorr ect because the text focuses on a
possible dir ect eff ect of individual acts of kindness, or single helpful actions, and it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o suggest that actions
can “r emember ,” or hold a memor y of, something. Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that Jung and her team

D. To asser t that Tom belie ves the gr oup per forming the pla y will be able t o successfully pr omote it
ID: 0a04cac5  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately por trays the main purpose of the text. A t the beginning of the text, Tom
asser ts that he and the other people staging the pla y are doing so only for “ a little amusement among ourselv es” and ar en’t
inter ested in attr acting an audience or any attention with the pr oduction. Then, Tom pr omises that the pla y the y chose is modest
and appr opriate, and he fur ther r easons that using the well-written pr ose of “ some r espectable author ” is better than using their
own wor ds. Ov erall, the main purpose of the text is t o conv ey Tom’s promise that the pla y will be inoff ensiv e and inv olve only a f ew
people.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t indicate that Tom had earlier intentions for the pla y’s per formance or that anything
has changed since the gr oup ﬁrst decided t o stage a pla y. Instead, the text focuses on how harmless the entir e endea vor will

words, he ne ver addr esses the idea that the people ar ound him gener ally ar en’t skilled enough t o stage a pla y. Choice D is
incorr ect because in the text Tom speciﬁcally sa ys that the y “want no audience, no publicity ,” which indicates that the y don ’t plan

A. recognizable
B. intriguing
C. signiﬁcant
D. useful
ID: 1fa751f1  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion about handedness in animals. As used in
this context, “r ecognizable ” means appar ent or identiﬁable. The text indicates that handedness is “ easy t o obser ve in humans, ” but
that animal-beha vior r esear chers use special tasks t o determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of “less”
befor e the blank indicate that compar ed with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less r ecognizable.
Choice B is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that handedness is less “intriguing, ” or fascinating, in
nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is t o obser ve handedness in humans as compar ed with
other animals; the text doesn ’t suggest that handedness is mor e fascinating in humans.  Choice C is incorr ect because ther e’s
nothing in the text t o suggest that handedness is less “ signiﬁcant, ” or impor tant or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in
humans. The text focuses on how easy it is t o obser ve handedness in humans as compar ed with other animals; the text doesn ’t
suggest that handedness is mor e signiﬁcant in humans. Choice D is incorr ect because “useful, ” or functional or helpful, wouldn ’t
mak e sense in context. The text focuses on the ease with which r esear chers can determine whether an animal or person is right-

Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. The text describes how the
narrator watches people working out at a gym thr ough a window near a bus st op. The narr ator sa ys that "ther e ain ’t nothing
funnier " than watching people tr y to work out on the stair climber machine. Thus, the main purpose of the text is t o describe an
activity that the narr ator ﬁnds amusing.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text isn ’t about the narr ator beginning middle school. The text describes how the narr ator ﬁnds
people working out at a gym amusing and mak es no mention of school lif e. Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mention
any pr oblems that the narr ator curr ently has or has o vercome. It just describes how the narr ator ﬁnds watching people work out
amusing. Choice D is incorr ect because the narr ator inv ents the made-up mo vie mentioned in the text. The text doesn ’t indicate

ID: 49bbe4d7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Jacob Lawr ence ’s artistic pr ocess. In this
context, “ obser vant” means watchful and per ceptiv e. The text emphasiz es that the “ close attention ” Lawr ence paid t o “all the
details” of his neighborhood allowed him t o reﬂect subtle elements of “the beauty and vitality of the Black experience ” in his
artwork. This context indicates that being obser vant of his surr oundings was an impor tant par t of Lawr ence ’s work as an ar tist.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that Lawr ence was “ skeptical, ” or had an attitude of doubt in gener al or
about par ticular things, let alone that sk epticism was impor tant t o him as an ar tist. Rather than indicating that he was sk eptical,
the text focuses on how Lawr ence paid car eful attention t o everything ar ound him and r eﬂected his obser vations in his ar twork.
Choice C is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that Lawr ence was “ critical, ” which in this context would mean inclined
to criticiz e harshly or unfairly . Rather than indicating that Lawr ence found fault in things, the text suggests that he paid car eful
attention t o everything ar ound him and that his ar twork r eﬂects this car eful attention. Choice D is incorr ect because the text
doesn ’t suggest that Lawr ence was “ conﬁdent, ” or self-assur ed. Rather than addr essing how Lawr ence f elt about himself and how
that f eeling aff ected his ar tistic pr ocess, the text emphasiz es the car eful attention Lawr ence paid t o everything ar ound him—

ID: f6d1f735  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of diaphr agm contr actions and hiccups. In
this context, “inv oluntarily ” means done without any contr ol, or b y reﬂex. The text explains that when a person ’s diaphr agm
repeatedly contr acts and r esults in hiccups (which ma y be beneﬁcial for infants), those muscle contr actions ar e “uncontr ollable. ”
This context indicates that the diaphr agm contr actions occur without the person ’s contr ol.
Choice B is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t suppor t the logical r elationship established in the text’ s discussion of diaphr agm
contr actions and hiccups. The text indicates that although speciﬁc causes for hiccups ha ven’t been identiﬁed, it ma y be the case
that the muscle contr actions that occur ha ve an impor tant purpose in infants. It wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that e ven though the
contr actions occur “beneﬁcially ,” or with a good or helpful eff ect, the y might pla y a positiv e role in infants’ br eathing r egulation.
Choice C is incorr ect because the text indicates that the diaphr agm contr actions that r esult in hiccups ar e “uncontr ollable. ”
Because those muscle contr actions ar e described as happening aut omatically and without the person ’s contr ol, it wouldn ’t mak e
sense t o describe them as occurring “ strenuously ,” or in a wa y that r equir es gr eat effor t or ener gy. Choice D is incorr ect because
the text doesn ’t describe the quality of the diaphr agm contr actions that r esult in hiccups be yond stating that the y are

ID: fcc328c6  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the function of the underlined por tion in the text as a whole. The
ﬁrst two sentences intr oduce the idea that soil and r ocks can be mo ved fr om one location t o another b y something other than
rivers and str eams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used b y scientists t o refer to this pr ocess is “ aeolian
transpor t.” The discussion that follows explains what aeolian tr anspor t is (the mo vement of small geological materials o ver
potentially gr eat distances b y the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust par ticles had been mo ved b y
aeolian tr anspor t from A ustralia t o Antar ctica. Thus, the underlined por tion intr oduces a scientiﬁc term that is used in the
discussion that follows.
Choice A is incorr ect because the underlined por tion of the text doesn ’t present any r emarks fr om Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest
that Diaz and her team encounter ed diﬃculties in their study . Instead, the phr ase in quotation marks in the underlined por tion
simply pr esents a term that is used b y scientists t o refer to a speciﬁc pr ocess discussed in the text. Choice C is incorr ect because
nothing in either the underlined por tion or the text as a whole suggests that the ﬁndings of the study pr esented in the text wer e
surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted t o see if aeolian tr anspor t could explain the
appear ance of cer tain geological materials in Antar ctica, and their ﬁndings did indeed conﬁrm the inv olvement of aeolian
transpor t. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the ﬁrst sentence of the text mentions soil and r ocks, which ar e two diff erent kinds of
geological material, the underlined por tion doesn ’t refer to these materials, nor does it explain the diff erence between them.
Rather , the underlined por tion intr oduces the scientiﬁc term “ aeolian tr anspor t,” which is used in the discussion that follows.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of wild rice. As used in this context,
"sensitiv e" means vulner able or easily aff ected. The text indicates that climate change is causing the lak es to get deeper , which
consequently thr eatens the wild rice that gr ows in the ar ea. The text goes on t o state that deep water can cause y oung wild-rice
plants t o upr oot fr om the bott om of the lak e. This context suppor ts the idea that the plants ar e sensitiv e to water depth during
early stages of de velopment.
Choice A is incorr ect because "immune " means pr otected or shielded, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in this context. The text
explains that deep water can cause y oung wild-rice plants t o become upr ooted and destr oyed, indicating that these plants ar e
harmed b y deep water , not pr otected fr om it. Choice C is incorr ect because "limited" means conﬁned or r estrained, which wouldn ’t
mak e sense in this context. The text explains that water depth can negativ ely aff ect y oung wild-rice plants but doesn ’t suggest
that water depth limits or r estrains the plants. Choice D is incorr ect because "r eceptiv e" means open or t olerant, which wouldn ’t
mak e sense in this context. The text doesn ’t indicate that the wild-rice plants ar e open t o or t olerant of an incr ease in water depth
but r ather the opposite: an incr ease in water depth can harm y oung wild-rice plants.

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Nuttall’ s 1886 r esear ch paper . In this

Nuttall’ s work as gr oundbr eaking because of its “ convincing demonstr ation ” related t o the age of the ancient sculptur es. In other
words, the r esear chers r ecogniz ed the gr oundbr eaking status of Nuttall’ s work.
Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, “ ensur ed” would mean t o ha ve guar anteed or made sur e something was the case.

Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that other r esear chers “ denied, ” or r efused t o admit or accept, that Nuttall’ s

taken on one side can ha ve envir onmental eff ects on the other side, making international cooper ation essential. 
Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. requir es
B. praises
C. repor ts
D. advises
ID: 5179f d36 Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of envir onmental management along the US
and Mexican bor der. In this context, "r equir es" means needs in or der t o per form a task. The text indicates that because
ecosystems span the bor der, actions tak en b y the go vernment on one side of the bor der can aff ect the envir onment in the nation
on the other side of the bor der, which mak es international cooper ation crucial. In other wor ds, because actions on one side of the
US and Mexican bor der can aff ect the other side of the bor der, managing envir onmental matters along the bor der r equir es
coor dination between the two go vernments.
Choice B is incorr ect because " praises" in this context would mean t o expr ess a fa vorable judgment, but the text doesn ’t describe
appr oval expr essed b y any one, and it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that envir onmental management itself pr aises
inter governmental coor dination. Choice C is incorr ect. In this context, "r epor ts" would mean giv es an account. Although
coor dination between the US and Mexican go vernments lik ely would inv olve some sor t of r epor ting, the text doesn ’t describe any
such pr actice. Choice D is incorr ect. In this context, " advises" would mean r ecommends a course of action, and although
governments can advise one another , it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that envir onmental management itself mak es
recommendations.

Scholarly accounts of the Chicano mo vement—a mo vement that adv ocated for the social, political, and cultur al empowerment of
Mexican Americans and r eached its z enith in the 1960s and 1970s— tend t o focus on the most militant, outspok en ﬁgur es in the

A. It presents a tr end in scholarship on the Chicano mo vement that the text claims has been r eevaluated b y resear chers in light of

D. It summariz es the conv entional method for analyzing the Chicano mo vement, which the text suggests cr eates a misleading
impr ession of the eff ectiv eness of neighborhood institutions and pr ojects.
ID: 1f2d6173  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. The
text begins b y mentioning scholarly accounts of the Chicano mo vement, which the underlined por tion describes as tending "t o
focus on the most militant, outspok en ﬁgur es in the mo vement, " making the mo vement as a whole seem uniformly r adical. The
text then indicates that the work of geogr apher Juan Herr era shows that focusing less on such militant ﬁgur es and instead pa ying
more attention t o manif estations of the Chicano mo vement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and pr ojects would
reveal that the mo vement’ s par ticipants embr aced a r ange of political orientations and appr oaches. Thus, the underlined por tion
describes a common appr oach t o studying the Chicano mo vement that, accor ding t o the text, obscur es the ideological div ersity of
the mo vement’ s par ticipants.
Choice A is incorr ect. Though the underlined por tion does pr esent a tr end in scholarship on the Chicano mo vement, the text does
not indicate that other scholars ha ve reevaluated their methods in light of Herr era’s work. It only indicates that Herr era’s work
suggests that the work of those other scholars does not pr ovide a complete pictur e of the Chicano mo vement. Choice B is
incorr ect. Though the underlined por tion does identify an aspect of the Chicano mo vement that the text indicates has been
overemphasiz ed, the text does not discuss the political orientations of the scholars whose work is mentioned in the text. Choice D
is incorr ect. Though the underlined por tion does summariz e the conv entional method for analyzing the Chicano mo vement, the
rest of the text does not addr ess the eff ectiv eness of " compar atively low-pr oﬁle neighborhood institutions and pr ojects. " Instead,
the text suggests that those pr ojects wer e led b y people with a v ariety of appr oaches t o community activism.

A. anticipate
B. inspect
C. reveal
D. justify
ID: 428cd2c1  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the helmets found in Denmark. In this
context, “justify ” means conﬁrm or giv e reasons for . The text indicates that scholars ha ve long been sk eptical about the supposed
Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The r adiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted b y Vandkilde and colleagues
demonstr ates that the helmets date fr om the Nor dic Br onze Age, making the helmets t oo old t o ha ve belonged t o Vikings. This
context suppor ts the idea that the scholars’ sk epticism is justiﬁed.
Choice A is incorr ect because “ anticipate ” means expect or come befor e, neither of which would mak e sense in context. The text
indicates that scholars ha ve long been sk eptical of the idea that the helmets belonged t o Vikings. Because the sk epticism has
existed for a long time, V andkilde and colleagues’ r esear ch couldn ’t be said t o anticipate it. Instead, the r adiocarbon dating r esults
justify or conﬁrm the scholar ’s skepticism. Choice B is incorr ect because “inspect” means examine or r eview , which wouldn ’t mak e
sense in this context. Resear ch ﬁndings ar e inanimate and ther efore unable t o inspect scholars’ sk epticism. The text focuses on
the origin of two helmets, which some people belie ve belonged t o Vikings. V andkilde and colleagues found that the helmets ar e
from the Nor dic Br onze Age and ther efore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the r esear chers’ ﬁndings justify ,
not inspect, the scholars’ sk epticism. Choice C is incorr ect because “r eveal” means unco ver or r epor t, which wouldn ’t mak e sense
in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people belie ve belonged t o Vikings. V andkilde and
colleagues tested the helmets and found that the y date t o the Nor dic Br onze Age and ther efore are much older than the Vikings.
This context suggests that the r esear chers’ ﬁndings conﬁrm or justify the scholars’ sk epticism, which was alr eady known so didn ’t

ID: 62a18353  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The expr ession “r econcile t o” means “t o cause (a person) t o accept something diﬃcult or
disagr eeable. ” The text suggests that John wants his mother t o accept his desir e to travel, even though she doesn ’t like that idea.
Choice B is incorr ect. This doesn ’t mak e sense. John doesn ’t want his mother t o apologiz e for his own desir e to travel—he wants
her t o accept his desir e to travel. Choice C is incorr ect. The text doesn ’t suggest that John wants his mother t o match his desir e to
travel. Rather , he wants her t o accept his desir e to travel even though she doesn ’t like it. Choice D is incorr ect. This is tempting,
because it seems t o pick up on the idea of people “r econciling” after a ﬁght, but it actually doesn ’t mak e sense. The text ne ver
suggests that John ’s mother was “united with ” the idea of him tr aveling in the past—if anything, it seems lik e she ’s alwa ys been

Choice B is incorr ect. Although in some contexts “ suggestion ” can r efer to an implied or indir ectly expr essed opinion, the text

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. exploiting
B. monetizing
C. appr aising
D. engendering
ID: 4b54bbf0  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how rising prices aff ected demand for
vintage cassette tapes. In this context, " engendering" means pr oducing or causing t o exist. The text indicates that the eff ect of a
dramatic incr ease in the price of vintage cassettes was counterintuitiv e, or contr ary to what would typically be expected. Gener ally,
when prices rise, demand falls—but the text indicates that in this case, buy ers who pr eviously had no inter est in cassettes
"thronged the mark et" (that is, many of them began pur chasing cassettes) because the y saw the cassettes as potential
investments. This context conv eys that the rising prices surprisingly pr oduced signiﬁcant demand, pr oducing many new buy ers for
vintage cassettes.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o describe the
price incr ease itself—r ather than sellers of vintage cassettes—as " exploiting, " or unfairly or selﬁshly taking adv antage of, demand.
Further, wanting t o tak e adv antage of new demand would be a motiv ation for a price incr ease, not a counterintuitiv e eff ect of it.
Choice B is incorr ect. In this context, " monetizing" would mean utilizing as a sour ce of pr oﬁt, and it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o
describe a price incr ease itself, r ather than sellers of vintage cassettes, as using demand as a sour ce of pr oﬁt; mor eover, seeking
to proﬁt when ther e’s new demand would be a r eason for price incr eases, not a counterintuitiv e eff ect of them. Choice C is
incorr ect. In this context, " appr aising" would mean assessing the v alue or signiﬁcance of something. The text focuses on a rise in
prices of vintage cassettes, and while it would be r easonable t o suggest that sellers might ha ve appr aised demand for those
cassettes, it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o suggest that a price incr ease itself could do such an assessment; mor eover, an appr aisal of
demand would most lik ely pr ecede a price incr ease r ather than be an eff ect of it.

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how hist orians ha ve treated r ank-and-ﬁle
(ordinar y) work ers in their analyses. In this context, " marginaliz e" means tr eat as unimpor tant or r elativ ely powerless within a
group or society . The text explains that accor ding t o Austin McCo y, hist orians ha ve tended t o treat " political, business, and labor
leaders" as the " major act ors" inv olved in making changes in or ganiz ed labor in the period after the Second W orld W ar. By
emphasizing the contributions of these leaders, hist orians ha ve in eff ect minimiz ed the contributions of or dinar y work ers, tr eating
them as r elativ ely unimpor tant and " nearly de void of agency ," ther eby mar ginalizing them.
Choice A is incorr ect. In this context, " epitomiz e" would mean either ser ve as an ideal example of something or mak e int o an
example of something, neither of which would mak e sense. In stating that hist orians ha ve tended t o char acteriz e political,
business, and labor leaders as the primar y act ors r esponsible for changes in the post-Second W orld W ar labor mo vement in a
manner that minimiz es the inﬂuence of or dinar y work ers, the text suggests that hist orians ha ve tended t o present or dinar y
work ers as unimpor tant t o or uninﬂuential within the mo vement, not that hist orians themselv es ser ve as examples of or dinar y
work ers, or that hist orians in their analyses ha ve made or dinar y work ers int o examples of the changes that occurr ed. Choice C is
incorr ect because in this context, " extol" would mean pr aise highly or glorify . The text states that hist orians ha ve tended t o present
ordinar y work ers as being " nearly de void of agency ," ther eby minimizing their impor tance. It ther efore wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y
that in doing so, hist orians ha ve tended t o praise or glorify them. Choice D is incorr ect because " substantiate " would mean v erify
with e vidence, and nothing in the text suggests that hist orians ha ve veriﬁed r ank-and-ﬁle work ers or their contributions in their
analyses. If anything, the text suggests the opposite, implying that b y minimizing work ers’ agency in or ganiz ed labor , hist orians

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Jha and Kr emen ’s ﬁnding about bees’
foraging beha vior. In this context, “homogeneous” means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some models
predict that the distance that bees tr avel when the y’re for aging declines as the density of ﬂowers incr eases. The text goes on t o
say, howe ver, that Jha and Kr emen identiﬁed a cir cumstance in which bees don ’t beha ve this wa y. Speciﬁcally , if bees encounter
“patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the ﬂowers ar e lar gely fr om the same species—the y’ll travel be yond
those patches t o get v aried food r esour ces. This context thus suggests that bees don ’t beha ve as some models pr edict if the
dense patches of ﬂowers the bees encounter ar e homogeneous. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that Jha and Kr emen found that bees will beha ve diff erently than some models
predict if the bees encounter ﬂower patches that ar e not rich in species, not if the ﬂowers ar e “depleted, ” or emptied or r educed in
quality or quantity . Although it could be true that bees ar e likely to lea ve depleted patches in sear ch of mor e resour ces, the text
doesn ’t indicate that Jha and Kr emen inv estigated that possibility . Choice C is incorr ect because ther e’s no information in the text
suggesting that bees will not beha ve as some models pr edict if ﬂowers in patches ar e “immatur e,” or not fully de veloped. Instead,
the text indicates that Jha and Kr emen found that bees will beha ve contr ary to some models’ pr edictions if the ﬂower patches ar e
not rich in species. Choice D is incorr ect because the text indicates that bees’ beha vior will be inconsistent with the pr edictions of
some models if the ﬂower patches that the bees encounter ar e of low species richness, not if the ﬂowers ar e in patches that ar e
“dispersed, ” or widely scatter ed. Although the text does describe bees as lea ving patches that ar e not rich in species t o for age
elsewher e, ther e’s no suggestion that Jha and Kr emen found that the distance between dense ﬂower patches aff ects whether the

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Gar dley’s pla y. In this context,
“comprises” means constitutes or mak es up the t otality of, and the text indicates that The House That Will Not Stand  had an “ all-
female cast” that stands in some r elationship t o “an arr ay of f emale char acters” in the pla y. Because all cast members ar e female,
the char acters must be pla yed b y these f emale cast members; ther efore the cast constitutes, or comprises, the collection of
char acters.
Choice A is incorr ect. In this context, “ engulfs” would mean encloses or o verwhelms, and although it is fairly common t o describe
an act or as embodying (or personifying r ealistically) a char acter , ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that the cast members
enclosed or o verwhelmed the char acters the y pla yed. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, “ encour ages” would mean
inspir es with cour age or hope. Although the text does mention “ a str ong mother and se veral daughters dealing with individual

to suggest that the cast members encour aged the char acters the y por trayed. Choice D is incorr ect because, in this context,
“provokes” would mean instigates or incites t o anger . Nothing in the text addr esses pr ovocation or what it might mean for act ors

Text 1
Despite its beautiful pr ose, The Guns of A ugust , Barbar a Tuchman ’s 1962 analysis of the star t of W orld W ar I, has cer tain
weaknesses as a work of hist ory. It fails t o addr ess e vents in Eastern E urope just befor e the outbr eak of hostilities, ther eby giving
the impr ession that Germany was the war ’s principal instigat or. Had Tuchman consulted secondar y works a vailable t o her b y
scholars such as L uigi Alber tini, she would not ha ve neglected the inﬂuence of e vents in Eastern E urope on Germany ’s actions.
 
Text 2
Barbar a Tuchman ’s The Guns of A ugust is an engr ossing if dated intr oduction t o World W ar I. Tuchman ’s analysis of primar y
documents is laudable, but her main thesis that E uropean powers committed themselv es to a catastr ophic outcome b y refusing t o
deviate fr om militar y plans de veloped prior t o the conﬂict is implausibly r eductiv e.
Which choice best describes a diff erence in how the authors of Text 1 and Text 2 view Barbar a Tuchman ’s The Guns of A ugust ?
A. The author of Text 1 ar gues that Tuchman should ha ve relied mor e on the work of other hist orians, while the author of Text 2
implies that Tuchman ’s most inter esting claims r esult fr om her original r esear ch.
B. The author of Text 1 belie ves that the scope of Tuchman ’s resear ch led her t o an incorr ect interpr etation, while the author of
Text 2 belie ves that Tuchman ’s centr al ar gument is o verly simplistic.
C. The author of Text 1 asser ts that the writing style of The Guns of A ugust  mak es it wor thwhile t o read despite any per ceived
deﬁciency in Tuchman ’s resear ch, while the author of Text 2 focuses ex clusiv ely on the weakness of Tuchman ’s interpr etation
of events.
D. The author of Text 1 claims that Tuchman would agr ee that W orld W ar I was lar gely due t o events in Eastern E urope, while the
author of Text 2 maintains that Tuchman would sa y that Eastern E uropean leaders wer e not committed t o militar y plans in the
same wa y that other leaders wer e.
ID: 17bf10de  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . Both texts ar e critical of The Guns of A ugust , but for diff erent r easons: the author of Text 1 ar gues
that Tuchman missed an impor tant fact or leading up t o the war because she didn ’t consult secondar y sour ces, and the author of
Text 2 ar gues that Tuchman ’s main thesis is "r eductiv e," which is a close synonym for " overly simplistic. "
Choice A is incorr ect. This doesn ’t accur ately describe the diff erence. This choice ’s summar y of Text 1 is accur ate, but Text 2 ne ver
says that Tuchman ’s most inter esting claims r esult fr om her original r esear ch. Choice C is incorr ect. This doesn ’t accur ately
describe the diff erence. Text 1 ne ver sa ys that The Guns of A ugust  is wor thwhile t o read despite its r esear ch weaknesses. Text 2
does call out a weakness of Tuchman ’s interpr etation of e vents, but it also pr aises her analysis of primar y sour ces. Choice D is
incorr ect. This doesn ’t accur ately describe the diff erence. Text 1 actually sa ys that Tuchman "fails t o addr ess" the inﬂuence of
events in Eastern E urope, while Text 2 sa ys that Tuchman ’s thesis was that E uropean powers (not Eastern E uropean leaders) wer e
committed t o militar y plans.

The following text is adapted fr om Kar el Čapek’ s 1920 pla y R.U.R. (Rossum ’s Univ ersal Robots ), translated b y Paul Selv er and Nigel
Playfair in 1923. F abry and Busman ar e telling Miss Glor y why their company manufactur es robots.
FABR Y: One Robot can r eplace two and a half  workmen . The human machine, Miss Glor y, was terribly  imper fect. It had t o be

BUSM AN: It was t oo expensiv e.
FABR Y: It was not effectiv e. It no longer answers  the r equir ements of  modern engineering . Natur e has no idea of k eeping pace

As used in the text, what does the wor d “answers” most nearly mean?
A. Explains
B. Rebuts
C. Defends
D. Fulﬁlls
ID: b4c6cff6  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “ answers” most nearly means fulﬁlls. In the text, F abry and Busman claim
that the r obots manufactur ed b y their company ar e mor e eﬃcient than human work ers, which the y refer to as “the human
machine. ” Fabry obser ves that the human machine “ no longer answers the r equir ements of modern engineering .” That is, human
work ers ar e incapable of meeting the rigor ous needs of modern, industrializ ed workplaces.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although in some contexts “ answers” can mean explains, it doesn ’t ha ve that meaning in this context
because the t opic under discussion is human beings’ inability t o per form labor eﬃciently , not their inability t o engage in discussion
or explanation. Choice B is incorr ect. Although in some contexts “ answers” can mean r ebuts, or pr oves a claim or ar gument t o be
false, it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o speak of pr oving  requir ements  to be false; r equir ements might or might not be r easonable, but
they can ’t be v eriﬁed as truthful or untruthful, as claims or accusations can. Choice C is incorr ect. Although in some contexts,
“answers” can mean def ends against criticism, or justiﬁes, it doesn ’t ha ve that meaning in this context because the opinion that
Fabry expr esses is that human work ers can no longer fulﬁll the r equir ements of modern workplaces, not that the y have ceased t o
justify those r equir ements or t o def end them against criticism; indeed, ther e is no suggestion in the text that work ers e ver
defended those r equir ements.

A. recommend
B. criticiz e

ID: d8d1ecaa  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The ﬁrst sentence tells us that video meetings ar e “less conduciv e to” (meaning less good for)
brainst orming. This suggests that the video meeting par ticipants’ focus is bad for their cr eativity . “Impede ” means “ dela y” or
“prevent,” which works per fectly in this context.
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice is t oo positiv e to ﬁt the context. The ﬁrst sentence tells us that video meetings ar e “less
conduciv e to” (meaning less good for) br ainst orming. This suggests that the video meeting par ticipants’ focus is bad for their
creativity . Choice B is incorr ect. This choice doesn ’t mak e sense. The par ticipants’ intense focus on the scr een is the subject of the
missing v erb. It wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that their o ver-focusing “ criticiz es” their cr eativity . Choice D is incorr ect. “Construct”
means “build” or “ mak e,” which is t oo positiv e to ﬁt the context. The ﬁrst sentence tells us that video meetings ar e “less conduciv e

ID: d0198544  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it accur ately describes how the author of Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o the underlined
claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that St orey found a genetic mutation in South American chick ens fr om befor e the E uropean
invasion and in P olynesian chick ens, which implies that chick ens wer e ﬁrst br ought t o South America b y Polynesian people. Text 2
explains that the genetic mutation St orey found is in chick ens fr om all o ver the world, thus under cutting the mutation as e vidence
of a P olynesian origin. Howe ver, Text 2 goes on t o sa y “[m]or e recently ” Luzuriaga-Neir a and colleagues found multiple genetic
mark ers shar ed b y South American and P olynesian chick ens but “that E uropean br eeds lack, ” which str ongly suggests a
Polynesian origin for the South American chick ens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 belie ves Luzuriaga-Neir a’s evidence for
a Polynesian origin is compelling while St orey’s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most lik ely agr ee
with the underlined statement and belie ves Luzuriaga-Neir a and colleagues’ e vidence for the statement is str onger than St orey’s
evidence is.
Choice A is incorr ect because both texts indicate that chick ens wer e intr oduced t o South America befor e the arriv al of E uropeans.
Text 1 states that the El Ar enal chick en bone dates fr om “1321–1407 CE—o ver a centur y befor e Europeans inv aded the r egion ”
and concludes that these chick ens wer e likely br ought t o South America b y Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the

incorr ect because both texts agr ee that chick ens wer e ﬁrst br ought t o South America b y Polynesian peoples (the underlined
claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any wa y deﬁcient because the possibility that animals could ha ve been

ID: a2be625e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately r eﬂects the main purpose of the text. The text por trays Miss P yne as
awaiting the arriv al of a carriage while Mar tha brings str awberries and ﬂowers fr om the gar den int o the house. The text also
describes the surr oundings of the scene, stating that Miss P yne looks " stately and calm, " the e vening is bright and cool, and bir ds
are singing in the gar den as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was " wide open t o the long-expected
guest, " which str ongly suggests that Miss P yne’s anticipation and Mar tha’s activities wer e in pr epar ation for the guest who is
expected t o arriv e in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conv eys what these char acters ar e doing as the y await the
arriv al of their visit or.
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e is nothing in the text t o indicate that the char acters f eel any worr y about the guest’ s arriv al.
The text indicates that the guest was "long-expected, " but char acterizing Miss P yne as " stately and calm " conﬂicts with the idea
that the char acters ar e worried about the guest. Choice B is incorr ect because the text describes a moment in time when two
char acters ar e awaiting the arriv al of a visit or rather than an extended period o ver which char acters could be seen changing.
Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text describes the activity indoors (Miss P yne sitting calmly), it describes a higher le vel of
activity , not stillness, outside (Mar tha bringing fruit and ﬂowers and bir ds singing).

Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Juar ez. In this context, “impor tant”
means mark ed b y signiﬁcant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juar ez, who was the ﬁrst pr esident of Mexico fr om an
Indigenous community , became a cer tain kind of ﬁgur e in Mexico ’s hist ory. It then suppor ts that claim b y describing some of the
“many signiﬁcant accomplishments” fr om Juar ez’s long tenur e in oﬃce. This context conv eys that Juar ez is a signiﬁcant and
consequential ﬁgur e in Mexico ’s hist ory.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text focuses on Juar ez’s role as the ﬁrst pr esident of Mexico fr om an Indigenous community
and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in oﬃce; nothing in the text suggests that Juar ez was
“unpr edictable, ” or tended t o beha ve in wa ys that couldn ’t be pr edicted. Choice C is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests
that Juar ez was a par ticularly “ secr etive” ﬁgur e, or that he tended t o keep things priv ate or hidden fr om others. Instead, the text
focuses on things that ar e known about Juar ez: that he was the ﬁrst pr esident of Mexico fr om an Indigenous community , that he
had a lengthy tenur e, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national go vernment’ s authority and
advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorr ect because the text focuses on the idea that Juar ez, who was the ﬁrst pr esident of
Mexico fr om an Indigenous community , had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in oﬃce. Rather than
suggesting that Juar ez was an “ ordinar y,” or common and typical, ﬁgur e in Mexico ’s hist ory, this context conv eys that Juar ez was

A tiny , unusual fossil in a piece of 99-million-y ear-old amber is of the extinct species Oculudenta vis khaungr aae. The O. khaungr aae
fossil consists of a r ounded skull with a thin snout and a lar ge e ye sock et. Because these f eatur es look lik e the y are avian, or

Paleont ologists wer e excited t o disco ver a second small fossil that is similar t o the str ange O. khaungr aae fossil but has par t of

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it r eﬂects what the paleont ologists in Text 2 would most lik ely sa y about what the
resear chers in Text 1 initially thought. Text 1 focuses on the disco very of a str ange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct
species Oculudenta vis khaungr aae. Accor ding t o Text 1, the fossil has f eatur es that appear t o be a vian, or r elated t o bir ds, which
led r esear chers t o initially think that the fossil might be a v ery small a vian dinosaur . Text 2 begins b y noting the disco very of a
second fossil similar t o the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleont ologists
think that the two cr eatur es wer e probably unusual lizar ds, e ven though the skulls appear ed a vian at ﬁrst. This suggests that the
paleont ologists in Text 2 r ecogniz e that the fossils do indeed look lik e the y could be r elated t o bir ds. F or this r eason, the
paleont ologists in Text 2 would most lik ely sa y that the initial thought of the r esear chers in Text 1—that the fossil was a vian—is
understandable, e ven if the fossil is pr obably not a vian but r ather is fr om a lizar d.
Choice B is incorr ect because Text 2 indicates that the fossils initially look ed a vian, so the paleont ologists described in Text 2
wouldn ’t be confused b y the r esear chers in Text 1 initially thinking that O. khaungr aae might be r elated t o bir ds. The
paleont ologists would ﬁnd that initial thought understandable, not confusing. Choice C is incorr ect because Text 1 ne ver mentions
lizards, so it wouldn ’t mak e sense for the paleont ologists in Text 2 t o sa y that the r esear chers in Text 1 mistak enly assumed that O.
khaungr aae must be a lizar d. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the paleont ologists in Text 2 might agr ee that the initial thought of

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of diadr omous ﬁsh. In this context,
"demar cated fr om" means separ ate or set apar t from. The text indicates that diadr omous ﬁsh diff er from eur yhaline ﬁsh in that
diadr omous ﬁsh " migr ate between fr eshwater and marine biomes during their lif e," wher eas eur yhaline ﬁsh do not r elocate t o a
different biome because the y can t olerate higher salinity envir onments. Ther efore, this context suggests that because of
differences between their migr ation patterns, diadr omous ﬁsh ar e distinct and can be demar cated fr om eur yhaline ﬁsh.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text states that diadr omous ﬁsh migr ate and r elocate, the text does not suggest that
diadr omous ﬁsh would be "r econstituted as, " or formed again as, anything new . Only their envir onments change and not the ﬁsh
themselv es. Choice C is incorr ect because the text does not suggest that diadr omous ﬁsh can be " conﬂated with, " or combined
with, eur yhaline ﬁsh. Instead, the text distinguishes the two types of ﬁsh b y pointing out their diff erences with r egar d to migr ation
and t olerance for salinity . Choice D is incorr ect because the text indicates that based on migr ation habits and t olerance for salinity ,
diadr omous ﬁsh ar e diff erent fr om eur yhaline ﬁsh; so it would not mak e logical sense t o sa y that diadr omous ﬁsh would be
"deriv ed fr om," or be an extension of or r esult fr om, eur yhaline ﬁsh.

The following text is adapted fr om Louise Er drich ’s 2020 no vel The Night W atchman . Louis Pipest one is collecting signatur es for a
petition fr om f ellow members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa on the tribe ’s reser vation in Nor th Dakota.
Louis Pipest one tended the petition lik e a gar den. He k ept it with him at all times. In t own, his e yes sharpened when he
noticed a tribal member who hadn ’t yet signed. Wher ever the y wer e—at the gas pump, mer cantile [gener al st ore], at Henr y’s
[Café], on the r oad, or outside the clinic and hospital—Louis corner ed them. If the y wer e waiting for a bab y to be born, he ’d
have them sign. If the y wer e laughing, if the y wer e arguing. If the y wer e taking a child home fr om school, the y signed.
©2020 b y Louise Er drich
Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A. To suggest that some tribal members r efuse t o sign the petition because the y dislik e Louis Pipest one
B. To show that attitudes t owar d the petition within the tribal community change o ver time
C. To demonstr ate that most tribal members ar e enthusiastic about signing the petition
D. To por tray Louis Pipest one’s str ong commitment t o collecting signatur es for the petition
ID: d9e55268  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately states the text’ s main purpose. The text indicates that Louis alwa ys had
his petition with him, ask ed e veryone he encounter ed to sign it if the y hadn ’t alr eady , and lists se veral comical cir cumstances in
which he might tr y to get someone t o sign. Thus, the main purpose of the text is t o illustr ate Louis’ s dedicated focus on getting
people t o sign the petition.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text suggests that Louis was aggr essiv e in seeking signatur es for the petition—for example,
saying that he " corner ed" people—nothing in the text addr esses how those people f eel t owar d Louis, let alone that the y are
refusing his r equest. Choice B is incorr ect because, other than por traying Louis’ s commitment t o gathering signatur es, the text
doesn ’t discuss community members’ attitudes t owar d Louis or the petition. Choice C is incorr ect because the text ne ver
mentions the attitudes of the people Louis appr oaches t owar d the petition, but the text does indicate that he " corner ed"
prospectiv e signat ories, str ongly suggesting that their enthusiasm was neither needed nor consider ed.

Text 1
It seems clear that emotional contagion (the unintentional tr ansf er of an emotional state fr om one person t o another) r equir es
physical inter action and the obser vation of body language.  After all, r esear ch shows that talking t o someone who is smiling and
expr essing positiv e feelings often causes people t o respond in a compar ably positiv e wa y. Similarly , displa ys of ner vous ﬁdgeting
have been found t o prompt others t o begin beha ving mor e ner vously , too.
 
Text 2
In an experiment using a social networking ser vice, Z eyao Y ang and Emilio F errara found e vidence of emotional contagion in text-
based online inter actions. The r esear chers disco vered that r eading social media posts that expr essed a positiv e outlook led
people t o mak e mor e positiv e posts themselv es, while posts with a negativ e emotional t one led people t o mak e mor e negativ e
posts.
Based on the texts, what would the r esear chers in Text 2 most lik ely sa y about the claim underlined in Text 1?
A. It perpetuates a ﬂawed understanding of emotional contagion, because ther e isn ’t enough e vidence t o suggest that smiling is
a sign of emotional contagion.
B. It reﬂects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because this phenomenon can occur e ven without in-person inter action.
C. It’s fairly persuasiv e, because studies attempting t o identify emotional contagion in situations without in-person inter action
have thus far yielded unclear r esults.
D. It’s mostly accur ate, because the social networking study conﬁrmed that emotional contagion primarily occurs in r esponse t o
negativ e emotions lik e ner vousness.
ID: faee8ec7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it r epresents how the r esear chers in Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o the underlined claim
in Text 1. Text 1 begins b y asser ting that the unintended tr ansf er of f eelings fr om one person t o another , known as emotional
contagion, seems t o rely on both people being physically pr esent and able t o obser ve body language. Text 1 then r eferences
resear ch that suppor ts this asser tion. Text 2 describes an experiment conducted b y the r esear chers Y ang and F errara in which
they found e vidence of emotional contagion in the absence of physical inter action, namely thr ough text-based inter actions on
social media. The r esear chers in Text 2 wouldn ’t completely agr ee with what is asser ted in the underlined por tion of Text 1 (that
emotional contagion seems t o requir e physical pr oximity), because their study , which used a social media networking ser vice,
found that physical inter action isn ’t the only wa y that emotional contagion can tak e place. Thus, the r esear chers in Text 2 would
most lik ely respond t o the underlined claim in Text 1 b y stating that it r eﬂects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because
the phenomenon can occur without an in-person inter action.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the r esear chers in Text 2 would lik ely agr ee that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a
ﬂawed conclusion that emotional contagion r equir es physical inter action, Text 2 doesn ’t addr ess what the r esear chers thought
about smiling as a sign of emotional contagion. Choice C is incorr ect because the r esear chers in Text 2 wouldn ’t say that the
underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasiv e. Accor ding t o Text 2, the r esear chers conducted a study that found emotional
contagion didn ’t requir e physical inter action, because the y found e vidence of it in text-based online inter actions. Choice D is

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it r eﬂects how the author of Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o what the r esear chers
mentioned in Text 1 contend. Text 1 discusses the lack of knowledge of how plate tect onics on Ear th began. Text 1 also mentions
resear chers who contend that mo vements of tect onic plates began ar ound 3 billion y ears ago. As suppor t for this asser tion, these
resear chers cite computer models (which ar e simulations, not empirical e vidence) of the temper ature in Ear th’s mantle that show
that at that time, the mantle would ha ve been suﬃciently molten for plates t o mo ve. Howe ver, the author of Text 2 asser ts that
empirical e vidence fr om the geological r ecor d is necessar y to mak e plausible claims about when tect onic mo vement began. Text
2 mentions an analysis per formed b y Wriju Chowdhur y and his team of the geochemistr y of zir con cr ystals (which would
constitute empirical e vidence). Chowdhur y and his team ar gue, based on this analysis, that tect onic plates ma y have begun t o
move as early as 4.2 billion y ears ago. Ther efore, since the author of Text 2 would consider Chowdhur y et al. ’s empirical e vidence
to be mor e conclusiv e than the computer models cited in Text 1, the author of Text 2 would most lik ely asser t that a mor e
deﬁnitiv e form of e vidence than the computer models suggests a diff erent timeline for the onset of plate tect onics on Ear th.
Choice A is incorr ect because the author of Text 2 mak es no claims about the temper ature of Ear th’s mantle and ther efore
wouldn ’t argue that the temper ature of Ear th’s mantle 3 billion y ears ago was insuﬃcient t o allow tect onic mo vement. Choice B is

Computer models ar e simulations, not empirical e vidence, so the author of Text 2 wouldn ’t distinguish between diff erent kinds of

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the fashion r esale mark et’s continued

indicates that the fashion r esale mark et made a lot of mone y in 2019 and that some analysts expected the mark et to continue t o

Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o sa y that some analysts “ produced, ” or manufactur ed or br ought

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how Of elia Z epeda has contributed t o the

Zepeda ’s many accomplishments in linguistics ar e varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetr y in mor e than one language,

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because the text indicates that F ox-Foot doesn ’t let the gr oup build a ﬁr e or cr eate a canoe landing

Choice B is incorr ect because the text conv eys that F ox-Foot doesn ’t want the gr oup t o be detected, not that he doesn ’t want their
presence t o create a blemish, or a spoiling ﬂaw , in the ar ea; human activity could disturb a natur al envir onment, but the context
emphasiz es that F ox-Foot is instead focused on a voiding giving any sign of the gr oup’s mo vements thr ough a place ("their

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically and pr ecisely completes the text’ s discussion of the fossil r ecor d from the
Cambrian period. In this context, “ abrupt” means sudden. The text explains that the fossil r ecor d reﬂects the unexpected
appear ance and r apid div ersiﬁcation, or incr ease in v ariety , of animal r emains during the Cambrian period. This context
establishes that these r emains’ entr y into the fossil r ecor d was sudden.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the wor d “explosion ” appears in the name of the e vent mark ed b y the fossil r ecor d change, the text
never suggests that the change was “ catastr ophic, ” or disastr ous. In context, “ explosion ” refers t o the r apid div ersiﬁcation, or the
swift incr ease in v ariety , of animal r emains in the fossil r ecor d—a phenomenon that the text pr esents in a r elativ ely neutr al manner ,
without commenting on whether it was negativ e or positiv e. Choice B is incorr ect because the text ne ver suggests that the change

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Y u’s no vel. In this context, “haphazar d”

which pr obably doesn ’t show the same v ariation on a lar ge scale. This suggests that the miner al composition of the samples ar e
unlik ely to be exactly the same fr om sample t o sample.
Choice A is incorr ect. "Neglected" means " suffering a lack of pr oper car e" or " abandoned, " which doesn ’t work her e. The text ne ver
suggests that the distribution of miner als in the samples would be neglected, so this statement doesn ’t logically follow . Choice B
is incorr ect. "Redundant" means " not or no longer useful or needed, " which is t oo str ong. The text doesn ’t suggest that the v ariation
between the samples isn ’t a useful ﬁnding at all—just that we can ’t assume that the lar ge-scale composition of the aster oid will
show the same v ariation. But the composition of the samples might be useful for something else. Choice C is incorr ect. "Ongoing"
means " still in pr ogress," which doesn ’t mak e sense: the distribution of miner als in a sample can ’t be " ongoing. "

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the kinds of mammals aliv e during the
Meso zoic er a. As used in this context, “ diverse ” means t o ha ve a signiﬁcant amount of v ariety . The text indicates that some
scientists ha ve suggested that Meso zoic mammals can ’t be char acteriz ed in a cer tain wa y, then contr asts the view put for ward by
those scientists with L uo’s resear ch, which shows that Meso zoic mammals “ weren’t all gr ound-dwelling insectiv ores” and instead
were “various. ” This context suggests that some scientists ha ve viewed Meso zoic mammals as being all alik e, or not a v ery
diverse gr oup. 
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that some scientists ha ve suggested that Meso zoic mammals
weren’t very “predat ory,” or that the y didn ’t prey on other animals, since the text establishes a contr ast between what some
scientists ha ve suggested and L uo’s resear ch showing that Meso zoic mammals “ weren’t all gr ound-dwelling insectiv ores.” This
context suggests that some scientists ha ve regar ded Meso zoic mammals as all being insectiv ores, or animals that pr ey on
insects, not that some scientists ha ve suggested that Meso zoic mammals didn ’t prey on other animals. Choice B is incorr ect
because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that some scientists ha ve suggested that Meso zoic mammals wer en’t very “obscur e,” or
concealed or not well known, since the text establishes a contr ast between what some scientists ha ve suggested and L uo’s
resear ch showing that Meso zoic mammals wer e a v aried gr oup. Ther e’s no contr ast between sa ying that the mammals wer en’t
concealed or well known and the mammals being v aried. Choice D is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that some
scientists ha ve suggested that Meso zoic mammals wer en’t very “localiz ed,” or conﬁned t o a par ticular ar ea, since the text
establishes a contr ast between what some scientists ha ve suggested and L uo’s resear ch showing that Meso zoic mammals wer e
a varied gr oup. Ther e’s no contr ast between sa ying that the mammals wer en’t localiz ed and the mammals being v aried. Although

Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the main purpose of the text. The text indicates wher e and when jazz tap
ﬁrst de veloped (in African American communities in the 1920s) and what inﬂuenced it (the quick rhythms and impr ovisations in

Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it logically and pr ecisely completes the text’ s discussion of The Mule Bone , a pla y that Z ora
Neale Hurst on and Langst on Hughes wr ote t ogether . In this context, “ collabor ation ” means working t ogether with someone t o
write a liter ary work. The text indicates that most writers pr efer to work alone and that working t ogether destr oyed the friendship
between Hurst on and Hughes. This establishes that The Mule Bone is a r elativ ely rare example of collabor ation in liter ature.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, “ char acterization ” would mean a liter ary work’ s por trayal of char acters’ psy chological
experiences and motiv ations, but the text doesn ’t discuss char acterization in The Mule Bone speciﬁcally or in collabor ative works
more gener ally. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, “interpr etation ” would mean the explanation of a liter ary work’ s
meaning or signiﬁcance, but the text doesn ’t discuss how r eaders or critics ha ve interpr eted The Mule Bone ; instead, the text

because in this context, “ commer cialization ” would mean writing a liter ary work in such a wa y as t o ensur e its commer cial appeal,

ID: 1fbf276a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the economist’ s claim about sales of
personal electr onic de vices. In this context, “inv alidate ” most nearly means nullify or mak e inv alid. The text indicates that
interruptions in the supply of micr ochips for personal electr onics “ha ve challenged” the economist’ s claim that sales of personal
electr onics will show str ong gr owth in the coming months. The text goes on t o clarify the eff ect of the dela ys on the economist’ s
projection, stating that the dela ys ar e very likely to extend the time fr ame o ver which the pr ojected gr owth in sales will occur . This
context suggests that the dela ys ar e unlik ely to inv alidate the economist’ s projection entir ely—the dela ys will pr obably alter the
time fr ame of the pr ojection, not nullify it or mak e it inv alid.
Choice A is incorr ect because sa ying that the dela ys ar e unlik ely to “dispute, ” or ar gue against, the economist’ s projection wouldn ’t
mak e sense. Since the dela ys ar e an inanimate cir cumstance, the y couldn ’t argue against a pr ediction about the sales of personal
electr onics. Choice B is incorr ect because sa ying that the dela ys ar e unlik ely to “withdr aw,” or r emo ve from consider ation, the
economist’ s projection wouldn ’t mak e sense. Although the economist could withdr aw her pr ojection because of the dela ys, the
dela ys themselv es couldn ’t withdr aw her pr ojection since the y’re an inanimate cir cumstance and thus can ’t choose t o remo ve
something fr om consider ation. Choice C is incorr ect because ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that the dela ys will

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text
presents information about a map dr awn b y Blackfoot chief Ac K o Mok Ki in 1801. The underlined sentence states that the map
"demonstr ates a v ast amount of t opogr aphic knowledge " and mentions that it f eatur es the " speciﬁc names of mountains and

the map was ex ecuted with r emarkable skill. Thus, the underlined sentence identiﬁes some r easons why the map is impr essiv e.
Choice A is incorr ect. Though the sentence after the underlined sentence in the text mentions that Ac K o Mok Ki included
information about other tribes on his map, the underlined sentence itself does not addr ess this t opic. Choice B is incorr ect
because nothing in the underlined sentence indicates how Ac K o Mok Ki became inter ested in mapmaking, only that his

Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of F rancis Cecil Sumner . As used in this

Black Howar d Univ ersity in 1930. This is e vidence that Sumner suppor ted incr easing the oppor tunity for Black students t o study

Choice B is incorr ect because the phr ase “ supplement t o,” or addition t o, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text discusses
Sumner ’s effor ts to incr ease the number of Black psy chology students, but it doesn ’t mak e sense t o describe him as an addition t o

Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion about how , for Schoenemann, a damaged
trilobite fossil was informativ e. In context, “ offered” means pr ovided or ga ve. The text suggests that although it ma y seem
counterintuitiv e, a br oken fossiliz ed trilobite allowed Schoenemann t o obser ve mor e details of the trilobite ’s eye than an intact
fossiliz ed trilobite would. This context conv eys the idea that a damaged fossil off ered, or pr ovided, fr esh insight int o the structur e
of a trilobite ’s eye.
Choice A is incorr ect because “r esolv ed” means determined or ﬁgur ed out, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in this context. The text
focuses on how Schoenemann was able t o get mor e information fr om a br oken fossil than an intact one. Although the damaged
fossil ma y have allowed her t o determine cer tain information, as an inanimate object the fossil isn ’t capable of r esolving anything.
Choice B is incorr ect because sa ying that the br oken par t of a trilobite fossil “ adjusted, ” or changed or modiﬁed, fr esh insight

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of P eter E dwar ds as a por trait painter . In

suggesting he is known and r espected for this type of painting. This choice clearly indicates that E dwar ds has established
recognition or fame speciﬁcally in connection with painting por traits of well-known individuals.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text pr esents E dwar ds’s por trait painting in a positiv e manner , describing his works as
"esteemed. " In this context, " complaint about" would mean dissatisfaction or grie vance r egar ding the activity of painting por traits,
which contr adicts the positiv e char acterization of E dwar ds’s work. Nothing in the text suggests that E dwar ds has expr essed any
dissatisfaction with or objection t o painting por traits of notable ﬁgur es. Choice C is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. The
ﬁrst sentence pr esents the gener al claim that industrial activity is not alwa ys a thr eat t o wildlif e. The underlined por tion of the
sentence that follows suggests that the silv er-studded blue butterﬂy is an example of wildlif e thriving in ar eas of industrial activity:
activ e limest one quarries. Thus, the function of the underlined por tion is t o intr oduce a speciﬁc example in suppor t of the gener al
claim in the pr evious sentence.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the ﬁrst sentence indicates that “industrial activity is often assumed” t o harm wildlif e, in the case
of the silv er-studded blue butterﬂy the text mentions neither an assumption about this species nor any challenge t o such an
assumption. Choice C is incorr ect because the text mentions only one study: the “ survey.” Additional studies ar e not mentioned in

Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins b y noting that
Anne “r eveled in the world of color about her ”—that is, she tak es gr eat delight in color ful things. It then r elates a scene when she
enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decor ate her r oom with it. The focus of the text
then shifts t o Marilla, who has an unde veloped “ aesthetic sense, ” or appr eciation of beauty , as can be seen when she dismisses
the maple lea ves as “ messy things” and criticiz es Anne for cluttering her r oom with objects fr om outside. This episode thus
illustr ates that Anne and Marilla diff er in their appr eciation of beauty and, mor e gener ally, in their basic char acter: Anne is
exuber ant and jo yful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Ther efore, the purpose of the text is t o show that Anne and Marilla ha ve
very diff erent personalities.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text pr esents Anne ’s appr eciation of natur e as a basic personality tr ait, not as a newfound
enthusiasm, and ne ver indicates how r ecently she de veloped that appr eciation. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text por trays
Anne and Marilla as ha ving diff erent personalities and attitudes t owar d natur al beauty and home decor ation, it doesn ’t show them
engaging in an ar gument about this diff erence or suggest that the y often ar gue about it. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text
does indicate that Marilla disappr oves of how Anne plans t o decor ate her r oom, Marilla ’s disappr oval is a suppor ting detail that
serves to de velop her personality , which the text as a whole contr asts with Anne ’s personality .

Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of solar ener gy collection and st orage. In
this context, "ﬂuctuations in " means irr egular changes in. The text notes that economists r ecommend that countries that want t o
rely mor e on solar ener gy (ener gy captur ed fr om sunlight) should attempt t o expand their st orage capacity . The text goes on t o
explain that ha ving a lar ge amount of st ored solar ener gy can lessen the negativ e eff ect of "unpr edictable shifts in cloud co ver and
haze"—that is, unpr edictable changes in envir onmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that ha ving
ample solar ener gy st ored and r eady t o use can mitigate the issue of ﬂuctuations in solar ener gy collection caused b y irregular
patterns of sunlight a vailability .
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, " developments of solar ener gy collection " would most clearly r efer to the cr eation of
ways to collect solar ener gy (ener gy captur ed fr om sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that ha ving st ored ener gy
can mitigate, or mak e less bad, the eff ects of a pr oblem caused b y unpr edictable changes that aff ect sunlight (" cloud co ver and
haze"); ther e’s no r eason t o think that the cr eation of new collection methods would be viewed as a pr oblem that would need t o be
mitigated. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context, " calibr ations with " would most clearly r efer to precise adjustments for a
particular purpose. The text focuses on the collection of solar ener gy (ener gy captur ed fr om sunlight) and the idea that ha ving
stored ener gy can mitigate, or mak e less bad, the eff ects of a pr oblem caused b y unpr edictable changes that aff ect sunlight
("cloud co ver and haz e"); ther e’s no r eason t o think that pr ecision in something r elated t o solar ener gy collection would be viewed
as a pr oblem that would need t o be mitigated. Choice D is incorr ect. The text focuses on the collection of solar ener gy (ener gy
captur ed fr om sunlight) and the idea that ha ving st ored ener gy can mitigate, or mak e less bad, the eff ects of a pr oblem caused b y
unpr edictable changes that aff ect sunlight (" cloud co ver and haz e"); nothing in the text suggests that "incentiv es for ," or r ewar ds

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of single-celled or ganism beha vior. As used
in this context, “rudimentar y” means basic or unsophisticated. Accor ding t o the text, a study of the single-celled pr otozoan Stent or

using new str ategies should other str ategies fail. This context suggests that single-celled or ganisms ma y not be limited t o
beha viors that ar e basic or rudimentar y, since the study showed that single-celled pr otozoans can r espond complexly t o irritating

Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that single-celled or ganisms ma y not be limited t o beha vior that is
“aggr essiv e,” or thr eatening. Rather , the text suggests that single-celled or ganisms ma y not be limited t o beha viors that ar e basic,

ID: d69bc408  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the o verall structur e of the text. The narr ator begins b y
explaining how Charlot car efully deliv ers A tlante ’s letter t o Rinaldo, and then r elates that Rinaldo f eels “tr anspor ted with jo y” after
reading the letter . Ther efore, the o verall structur e of the text is best described as a description of the deliv ery of a letter followed
by the por trayal of a char acter ’s happiness after r eading the letter .
Choice B is incorr ect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; ther e’s no explanation why another char acter
hasn ’t written one. In addition, the text’ s description of Rinaldo “in a melancholy postur e” suggests that he ’s sad and thoughtful,
not that he ’s desper ate t o receiv e the letter . Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text states that Charlot won ’t toss the letter t o
Rinaldo because she doesn ’t want it t o fall, the text doesn ’t refer to the contents of the letter . Instead, the text describes how happ y
Rinaldo f eels after r eading it. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text does describe Rinaldo ’s reaction t o the letter , the text doesn ’t

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The author of Text 2 agr ees with the author of Text 1 that bumblebees ma y engage in pla y and
possibly experience some kind of positiv e emotional state. Howe ver, the author of Text 2 also qualiﬁes this claim b y stating that
emotions in insects, if the y do exist, ar e “lik ely v ery rudimentar y.”
Choice A is incorr ect. While Text 2 states that other studies might indicate “ negativ e emotional states” in bees, it does not

Text 2 does not mention or imply that any insects, including bumblebees, ar e capable of experiencing complex emotional states.
The author of Text 2 states that if insects do f eel emotions, those emotions ar e “lik ely v ery rudimentar y.” Choice C is incorr ect. The

ID: 53542eb5  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of pr ograms that encour age mone y to cycle
within a community . In this context, "instituting" means initiating. The text indicates that making pur chases at small local
businesses can help k eep mone y cycling within a community . The text goes on t o state that some cities ar e establishing
incentiv es to promote small business shopping. This context suppor ts the idea that some cities ar e instituting pr ograms t o
encour age this consumer beha vior.
Choice B is incorr ect because sa ying that some cities ar e "occup ying, " or for cibly holding possession or contr ol of, pr ograms that
encour age shoppers t o mak e pur chases at small local businesses wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text doesn ’t discuss who
contr ols these pr ograms but instead indicates that some cities ar e establishing incentiv es that encour age shoppers t o mak e
purchases at small local businesses. F urthermor e, it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that a city is occup ying a pr ogram. Choice C is
incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that cities ar e "under estimating, " or failing t o understand the v alue of, pr ograms
that encour age consumers t o shop at small local businesses. The text indicates that some cities ar e establishing incentiv es to
encour age small business shopping, which suggests that these cities understand the v alue of such pr ograms. Choice D is
incorr ect because sa ying that some cities ar e "encountering, " or coming int o contact with, pr ograms that encour age consumers t o
shop at small local businesses wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text indicates that some cities ar e alr eady establishing
incentiv es to encour age shoppers t o mak e pur chases at small businesses. This context suggests that the cities ar e instituting the

Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the method the inhabitants of the Mexica
empir e used t o track time. In this context, " exactitude " means pr ecision. The text indicates that the Mexica used the sun ’s position
relativ e to various natur al landmarks t o track the passage of time, explaining that such methods allowed the Mexica t o accur ately
determine the dates of impor tant e vents such as solstices. This context suppor ts the idea that the Mexica people wer e able t o
track time with a high degr ee of pr ecision, or exactitude.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context " precariousness" would mean instability , and ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest
that the method used b y the Mexica people t o track time was unstable or pr oduced unstable r esults. Rather , the text indicates that
the method yielded pr ecise r esults, allowing the Mexica t o accur ately determine the dates of signiﬁcant e vents. Choice C is
incorr ect because in this context "r esilience " would mean persistence, and ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that the Mexica
work ed stubbornly in spite of obstacles in or der t o track time. Choice D is incorr ect because in this context "inconspicuousness"
would mean discr eetness, and ther e’s nothing in the text t o suggest that the Mexica wanted t o track time without being noticed.

Wakako Y amauchi is best known for And the Soul Shall Dance , her 1977 pla y about a Japanese American family in Southern

relies on dialogue between char acters, but the original st ory featur es little dialogue and instead describes its char acters’ silent

D. It describes how Y amauchi chose the act ors who per formed in the pla y.
ID: 662892ad  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. Accor ding t o
the text, it was har d for Y amauchi t o adapt her shor t story into the pla y And the Soul Shall Dance  because the st ory had included
little dialogue, instead describing the char acters’ silent thoughts. The underlined sentence off ers information about how Y amauchi
ultimately succeeded in adapting the st ory into a pla y: it explains that Y amauchi cr eated situations wher e the char acters of the
play could r eveal their internal thoughts while speaking with each other .
Choice B is incorr ect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole mak es any mention of pla ywrights other
than Y amauchi or how the pla y might ha ve inﬂuenced them. Choice C is incorr ect because the text states that Y amauchi is best
known for her pla y And the Soul Shall Dance , which conv eys that the pla y is better known than the shor t story it’s based on is.
Choice D is incorr ect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole mentions the act ors who per formed in the

ID: d563bf65  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. In the ﬁrst sentence of the text,
the narr ator states that she thinks ther e’s a chance she will become par t of the bask etball team at her college. She goes on t o
explain that she is " quick" and "t ough. " Based on these char acteristics, she thinks she has a chance t o join the team. Thus, the
main purpose of the text is t o explain why the narr ator thinks she might mak e the bask etball team.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text focuses solely on bask etball and doesn ’t mention any other kinds of spor ts. Choice B is
incorr ect because the text doesn ’t describe aspects of the game of bask etball. Instead, it pr ovides the narr ator’s reasoning for
thinking that she might mak e her school bask etball team. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the narr ator explains why she thinks she
will be chosen for the bask etball team at her school, the text doesn ’t go int o the gener al decision-making pr ocess or the

Although food writing is one of the most widely r ead genr es in the United States, liter ary scholars ha ve long neglected it. And
within this genr e, cookbooks attr act the least scholarly attention of all, r egar dless of how well written the y ma y be. This is
especially true of works dedicated t o regional US cuisines, whose complexity and hist orical signiﬁcance ar e often o verlook ed.
 
Text 2
With her 1976 cookbook The Taste of Countr y Cooking , Edna Lewis populariz ed the r eﬁned Southern cooking she had gr own up
with in F reetown, an all-Black community in Vir ginia. She also set a new standar d for cookbook writing: the r ecipes and memoir
passages interspersing them ar e written in pr ose mor e elegant than that of most no vels. Yet despite its inar guable v alue as a
piece of writing, Lewis’ s masterpiece has r eceiv ed almost no attention fr om liter ary scholars.
Based on the two texts, how would the author of Text 1 most lik ely regar d the situation pr esented in the underlined sentence in
Text 2?
A. As typical, because scholars ar e dismissiv e of liter ary works that achie ve popularity with the gener al public
B. As unsurprising, because scholars tend t o overlook the liter ary value of food writing in gener al and of r egional cookbooks in
particular
C. As justiﬁable, because Lewis incorpor ated memoir int o The Taste of Countr y Cooking , thus undermining its status as a
cookbook
D. As ine vitable, because The Taste of Countr y Cooking was mark eted t o readers of food writing and not t o readers of other
genr es

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . Text 1 states that liter ary scholars ignor e regional cookbooks most of all, e ven when the y have
historical signiﬁcance and ar e well written. So the author of Text 1 wouldn ’t be surprised that scholars ignor ed E dna Lewis’ s
cookbook.
Choice A is incorr ect. W e can ’t inf er that this is how the author of Text 1 would r egar d the situation. Text 1 ne ver suggests that

ID: d7807ec8  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of political blogs. In this context, " sanguine "
means optimistic. The text begins b y noting the rise of political blogs with r eadily identiﬁable ideological alignments in the early
2000s. The text then indicates that some commentat ors saw this as a positiv e de velopment, citing a r eason why (their diff erence
from tr aditional news). Finally , the text goes on t o contr ast those commentat ors with others who ha ve a negativ e opinion of the
rise of political blogs (because the y incr ease political polarization among their r eaders). This context suppor ts the idea that the
second gr oup of commentat ors is less positiv e than the ﬁrst: thus, the second gr oup of commentat ors is less optimistic, or
sanguine.
Choice B is incorr ect because it would not mak e sense in this context t o describe those commentat ors who ha ve a negativ e
opinion of political blogs as less "r ecalcitr ant," or obstinately uncooper ative, than those commentat ors who suppor ted political
blogs. Choice C is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that those commentat ors who ha ve a negativ e opinion of political
blogs ar e less " misanthr opic, " or less contemptuous of humankind, than those commentat ors who ha ve a positiv e opinion of
political blogs—ther e is no indication in the text that those commentat ors who lik e political blogs would be contemptuous of
humankind at all. Choice D is incorr ect because ther e is no e vidence that those commentat ors who ha ve a negativ e opinion of
political blogs ar e less " earnest, " or sincer e, than those who ha ve a positiv e opinion of such blogs—pr esumably , both gr oups of

D. Vague
ID: e1e89221  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "r ough " most nearly means harsh, or for ceful and unpleasant. The text
describes Mar y’s surr oundings as she pla ys: the sun is out and ther e’s "a little wind. " To fur ther illustr ate the wind, the narr ator
contr asts the wor d "rough " with a description of the wind blowing in " delightful little gusts, " suggesting that the wind is not
unpleasant or harsh at all.
Choice B is incorr ect. Although in some contexts "r ough " objects, or objects with irr egular sur faces, can sometimes be scr atchy ,
rough doesn ’t mean scr atchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not r ough but r ather gentle, " delightful little gusts, "
which suggests that the use of "r ough " her e is r eferring t o the degr ee of for ce of the wind. Choice C is incorr ect because ther e’s
nothing in the text t o suggest that the wind wasn ’t "basic, " or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as

ID: b11bb2a3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as " a void" space, which most nearly means
an empty or v acant one. In the text, the speak er describes summer time in counterintuitiv e terms: although natur e’s "surging lif e is
at its full" during the season, the speak er feels summer t o be " a time of pause, / A v oid and silent space between two worlds. " The
speak er sa ys fur ther that during summer , "feeling sleeps / Gathering str ength " for futur e effor ts. Thus, the speak er regar ds
summer as an empty str etch of time, t o be followed b y a period of gr eater activity .
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text does pr esent summer as a time of inactivity , it doesn ’t char acteriz e that inactivity as
useless, or as ha ving no purpose; in fact, the speak er regar ds summer as a time when "f eeling" gathers " strength for effor ts yet to
come. " Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text char acteriz es summer as a time " when inspir ation lags, and f eeling sleeps, " it
doesn ’t discuss the season ’s relationship t o the speak er’s memor y or suggest that summer can easily be for gotten. Choice D is
incorr ect. In some contexts, "v oid" can mean de void of, or lacking, a par ticular element, and such a lack could be conceiv ed of as
incompleteness. Howe ver, the text doesn ’t por tray summer as not being complete or whole; instead, it char acteriz es vacancy or

ID: 97360a00  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the o verall structur e of the text. Throughout the text, the

veil “over her face ” and who mo ves her hands “ slowly with their gem-starr ed light” thr ough her dark hair . Thus, the text is
structur ed as an extended comparison of night t o a human being.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text ne ver mentions any par ticular location; instead, it focuses on pr esenting a single
description of night as a person with cer tain clothing and f eatur es. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mak e any
reference t o the sun or sunrise; instead, it focuses on pr esenting a single image of night as a person with cer tain clothing and

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Samuel R. Delany ’s char acter Ry dra
Wong. As used in this context, “ atypical” would mean unr epresentativ e or not common. The text indicates that W ong is one of
“nearly a do zen” char acters in Delany ’s no vels who ar e poets or writers. This context conv eys that being a poet isn ’t an atypical
occupation for a char acter in one of Delany ’s works.  
Choice A is incorr ect because “infallible ” means t o be accur ate or without fault, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text
focuses on the fact that Delany has written many char acters who ar e poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation
isn’t atypical for Delany , not that the occupation isn ’t infallible, or pr oblematic. Choice C is incorr ect because “lucr ative” means t o

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Y aszek’s intr oduction t o her science

"deliber ately signaled" political themes in woman-author ed science ﬁction fr om the 1920s t o the 1960s and what Y aszek notes
about woman-author ed science ﬁction fr om the 1970s. This contr ast implies that the work fr om the 1970s did clearly r eﬂect

Choice A is incorr ect. In this context " prudently " would mean cautiously , which might plausibly describe the women who wr ote
science ﬁction fr om the 1920s t o the 1960s, in that the y tended t o avoid r evealing their political views; howe ver, the text contr asts
these authors with the women writing science ﬁction in the 1970s, ther eby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s wer e

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how k elp for ests help marine animals. In
this context, "tr anquil" means fr ee fr om disturbance, or calm. The text indicates that ocean curr ents ar e power ful and mak e it

kelp for ests cr eate a mor e tranquil envir onment.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text indicates that k elp for ests pr ovide shelter for marine animals, meaning the y create

currents in the ocean, and it isn ’t clear how an ocean envir onment could be "imaginativ e," or full of imagination. Choice D is
incorr ect because the text indicates that k elp for ests cr eate a calm and saf e envir onment, and an envir onment that is " surprising"

ID: 4fa7e50e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the fact ors that inﬂuence peoples’
decisions t o mo ve to a diff erent state. As used in this context, “ overshadowed b y” means t o be surpassed b y or caused t o seem
less impor tant than other fact ors aff ecting a mo ve. The text indicates that, accor ding t o a US tax policy exper t, when people think
about an interstate mo ve, state tax es ha ve little eff ect on their decisions, while emplo yment oppor tunities, housing a vailability , and
climate ha ve a v ery str ong eff ect. This context suggests that people consider these other fact ors t o be mor e impor tant than state
taxes. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that state tax es ar en’t as impor tant a consider ation as other fact ors when people
are thinking of mo ving t o another state. The context doesn ’t suggest that state tax es ar e “consistent with, ” or in agr eement with
these other fact ors. Choice B is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o sa y that state tax es ar e “representativ e of,”
or typical of, other fact ors. Taxes ar en’t an example of emplo yment oppor tunities, housing a vailability , and climate, which ar e the
other fact ors listed in the text. Choice D is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o sa y that state tax es ar e
“irrelevant t o,” or unconnected or unimpor tant t o other fact ors. State tax es ar e irrelevant t o peoples’ decisions, not t o other fact ors.
In other wor ds, although the text suggests that state tax es ma y be irr elevant t o people considering a mo ve to another state, the
other fact ors mentioned in the text, such as emplo yment oppor tunities, ar e unable t o ha ve an opinion about state tax es.
Furthermor e, the text indicates that signiﬁcant diff erences in state tax es ha ve almost no eff ect on peoples’ choices t o mo ve, but
they aren’t completely unimpor tant.

The following text is adapted fr om Susan Glaspell’ s 1912 shor t story “‘Out Ther e.’” An elderly shop owner is looking at a pictur e

It did seem that the pictur e failed t o ﬁt in with the r est of the shop. A persuasiv e young f ellow who claimed he was closing out
his st ock let the old man ha ve it for what he called a song. It was only a little out-of-the-wa y store which subsisted chieﬂy on the
framing of pictur es. The old man look ed ar ound at his views of the city , his pictur es of cats and dogs, his ﬂaming bits of
landscape. “Don ’t belong in her e,” he fumed.
And y et the old man was secr etly pr oud of his acquisition. Ther e was a hidden dignity in his scowling as he shuﬄed about

B. To conv ey the shop owner ’s resentment of the person he got the new pictur e from
C. To describe the items that the shop owner most highly priz es
D. To explain diff erences between the new pictur e and other pictur es in the shop
ID: aa7f c89b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins b y stating that the
new pictur e “failed t o ﬁt in ” with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on t o illustr ate that point b y describing the
other pictur es the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn ’t think the new pictur e belongs in
the st ore. In the second par agraph, howe ver, the text indicates that the shop owner is “ secr etly pr oud of his acquisition. ” The main
purpose of the text is thus t o reveal the shop owner ’s conﬂicted f eelings about the new pictur e.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that the shop owner r esents the y oung man who sold him the new pictur e;
in fact, the text giv es no indication of the owner ’s feelings about the y oung man at all. Choice C is incorr ect. Although the text
indicates that the new pictur e is diff erent fr om the other items in the shop, ther e’s no suggestion that the shop owner priz es either
the new pictur e or the pictur es of the city , pets, and landscapes mor e than he priz es any other items. Choice D is incorr ect
because the text doesn ’t describe what the new pictur e looks lik e; rather , the text identiﬁes some of the other kinds of images that
the shop owner has and states that the y’re diff erent fr om the new pictur e without explaining how the y’re diff erent.

The people of medie val Europe ha ve traditionally been seen as uninter ested in cleanliness and hy giene, but modern r esear ch has

D. It explains why Janega decided t o study the popularity of public bathhouses in medie val Europe.
ID: e23f50b9  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most eff ectiv ely describes the function of the underlined por tion. The text discusses the
long-standing misconception that people in medie val Europe wer e uninter ested in cleanliness and hy giene. As e vidence that this
idea is false, the text cites hist orian Eleanor Janega ’s asser tion that in medie val Europe, t owns usually had at least one bathhouse,
wher e people could tak e immersion baths or steam baths for a f ee. The underlined por tion then notes that mainly t own dwellers
had access t o these bathhouses. The r emainder of the text explains that those who lack ed such access wer e nonetheless able t o
bathe in outdoor water ways or tak e sponge baths at home. Ther efore, the underlined por tion concedes that some people in
medie val Europe lack ed access t o public bathhouses.
Choice A is incorr ect. The underlined por tion establishes that amenities such as steam baths wer e mainly a vailable t o town
dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths wer e lar gely una vailable t o people in rur al ar eas. Thus, the distinction made b y
the underlined por tion is not between the popularity of steam baths in t owns v ersus their lack of popularity in rur al ar eas but
instead between their pr esence in t owns and absence in rur al ar eas. Choice B is incorr ect. Although the text does explain that
recent hist orians ha ve dispr oved the idea that medie val Europeans r arely bathed, it doesn ’t attribute that misconception t o earlier
historians of medie val Europe or suggest that their r esear ch was subject t o limitations. Mor eover, the underlined por tion
addr esses a limitation of lif e in medie val Europe, not of hist orical r esear ch. Choice D is incorr ect because the underlined por tion
doesn ’t addr ess why hist orian Eleanor Janega decided t o study the popularity of public bathhouses in medie val Europe—nor does
any por tion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn ’t go int o detail about why she decided t o study the
popularity of public bathhouses in medie val Europe.

Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of painter Alma W. Thomas’ s work. In this
context, "inﬂuenced" means t o ha ve had an eff ect on something’ s development. The text indicates that ther e is a connection
between Thomas’ s work and the ﬂowers and tr ees in her home ’s gar den, giving the example of Thomas’ s brushstr okes being

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and pr ecise wor d or phr ase?
A. thoughtfulness
B. esteem
C. contr oversy
D. sincerity
ID: c218cd98  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Benjamin F ranklin ’s popularity in F rance.
In this context, " esteem " means high r egar d. The text indicates that F ranklin was v ery popular , or highly r egar ded, in F rance, wher e
he sought the countr y’s suppor t for the United States in its ﬁght for independence, and indicates that his status helped him
achie ve his goal. The context ther efore suggests that being held in high r egar d by the people lik ely helped F ranklin convince
France t o help the United States.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text dir ectly indicates that it was F ranklin ’s popularity that lik ely helped him convince F rance t o
help the United States, not his "thoughtfulness" (which in this context would mean either his car eful r easoning and attention or his
kind consider ation of others’ needs). Choice C is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that ther e was any " contr oversy," or
dispute, about F ranklin ’s presence in F rance; instead, the text states that F ranklin was v ery popular in F rance and dir ectly indicates
that this status lik ely helped him convince F rance t o help the United States. Choice D is incorr ect because the text dir ectly
indicates that it was F ranklin ’s popularity that lik ely helped him convince F rance t o help the United States, not his " sincerity ," or his

Some animal species, lik e the leopar d, can be found in many kinds of ar eas. On the other hand, tr opical mountain bir d species
tend t o be limited in the types of spaces the y can call home. This is because many mountain bir d species ar e only able t o sur vive
at very speciﬁc ele vations. Ov er time, these species ha ve likely become used t o living at a speciﬁc temper ature. Ther efore, these
species struggle t o sur vive at ele vations that ar e warmer or colder than the y are used t o.
 
Text 2
A new study r eviewed obser vations of nearly 3,000 bir d species t o understand why tr opical mountain bir d species liv e at speciﬁc
elevations. They noted that when a mountain bir d species was found in an ar ea with many other bir d species, it tended t o inhabit
much smaller geogr aphic ar eas. It is thus lik ely that competition for r esour ces with other species, not temper ature, limits wher e
these bir ds can liv e.
Based on the texts, both authors would most lik ely agr ee with which statement?
A. Tropical mountain bir d species ar e restricted in wher e the y can liv e.
B. Scientists ha ve better t ools t o obser ve tropical mountain bir ds than the y did in the past.

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . Both texts state that tr opical mountain bir d species ha ve limited r anges or habitats, although the y

Part of the A tacama Deser t in P eru has surprisingly rich plant lif e despite r eceiving almost no r ainfall. Moistur e from winter fog

ID: 8bc66f89  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. The
ﬁrst two sentences establish a natur al phenomenon: ther e is a richness of plant lif e found in the A tacama Deser t despite the har d
soil that mak es it challenging for seeds t o germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined por tion, off ers a potential
explanation for the phenomenon: local bir ds dig gr ound nests exposing seeds t o moistur e and materials in the soil necessar y for
germination. The last sentence summariz es a study that compar ed the f ertileness of mounds of dir t dug up b y birds to mounds
that wer e undisturbed t o suppor t the explanation in the underlined por tion. Thus, the underlined por tion mainly functions t o
explain how cer tain bir ds pr omote seed germination in the A tacama Deser t soil.
Choice A is incorr ect because the underlined por tion doesn ’t addr ess the t opic of the soil’ s tough crust or its formation. Instead,
the text elabor ates on the idea that local bir ds that build gr ound nests ma y help seeds germinate in the har d soil. Choice B is
incorr ect because the underlined por tion describes how some bir ds ma y suppor t seed germination in A tacama Deser t soil but
doesn ’t describe how the seeds ar e deposited int o the soil befor e germination begins.  Choice C is incorr ect because neither the

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, " speciﬁc " most nearly means par ticular . The text is r eferring t o the
particular view of the P ort of Oakland as seen fr om a subwa y train as it rises fr om under ground. This speciﬁc, or par ticular , view
has alwa ys been special t o Moss, a lif etime r esident of W est Oakland.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text itself is a work of ﬁction, the view is something Moss can point out t o his companions on

signiﬁcant t o Moss, nothing in the text describes the view as par ticularly ener getic as opposed t o calming, for example. Choice C
is incorr ect. The point of the text is that the view of the P ort of Oakland fr om the subwa y train as it rises fr om under ground is

ID: b93428a6  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Bast os’s study of a wild k ea parr ot. In this
context, " accidental" means unplanned or unintentional. The text ﬁrst describes Bast os’s study , which concerns a k ea that is
obser ved using small st ones t o preen its f eathers. The text then mentions colleagues who ar e skeptical (that is, the y have doubt)
about Bast os’s ﬁndings, and ﬁnally describes how Bast os and her team r esponded t o the sk epticism of those colleagues. Giv en
that the colleagues mentioned in the text expr essed sk epticism r egar ding Bast os’s ﬁndings, the best answer choice must be one
that completes the text in a manner such that the sk eptics’ opinion r egar ding the k ea’s use of st ones disagr ees with that held b y
Bast os and her team. Since Bast os and her team showed that the k ea’s use of st ones was deliber ate (that is, intentional), the
skeptics’ opinion in this context must be that the k ea’s use of st ones was unintentional, or accidental.
Choice A is incorr ect because the best answer choice is one that por trays sk epticism, or doubt, of Bast os’s claim that the k ea’s
usage of st ones was deliber ate, or intentional. If the sk eptics found the k ea’s usage of st ones "intriguing, " or fascinating, this
would not be at odds with the position of Bast os and her team; in fact, it is r easonable t o belie ve that someone who agr eed that
the k ea’s stone usage was deliber ate would also ﬁnd it intriguing. Choice B is incorr ect because if the sk eptics belie ved that the
kea’s usage of small st ones was " obvious, " or e vident, this would not be contr ary to the obser vation of Bast os and her team that
the k ea’s usage of st ones was deliber ate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other . Choice D is incorr ect
because if the sk eptics belie ved that the k ea’s usage of small st ones was " obser vable, " or visible, this would not conﬂict with the
claim of Bast os and her team that the k ea’s usage of st ones was deliber ate: instead, these positions would agr ee.

Choice D is the best answer . Author 1 acknowledges that Lewis sculpted other subjects besides hist orical and mythical ﬁgur es,
suggesting a v ariety of subjects depicted. A uthor 2 mentions that Lewis car ved por trait busts as well as hist orical sculptur es,
which also implies v ariation among Lewis’ s subjects.
Choice A is incorr ect. Neither text suggests that Lewis’ s por trait busts ha ve receiv ed mor e attention or appr eciation than her other

ID: 7a0e31ea  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text, which is t o por tray Francie ’s
determination t o reach her goal of r eading all the books in the world. The text indicates that t o achie ve this aim, F rancie works
systematically and persistently: she r eads all the books in the libr ary in alphabetical or der and de votes much time and effor t to the
project, ﬁnishing one book per da y over a long period of time. The text then suggests that e ven though she pr ogresses slowly (" she
was still in the B’ s") and that she struggled with some books (" some of the B’ s had been har d going"), she doesn ’t giv e up because
she thinks of herself as " a reader ." These details show F rancie ’s resolv e.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text mentions se veral topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda v acations, and Byzantine
architectur e) that F rancie has r ead about, it doesn ’t indicate that any of these t opics ar e unusual or that she especially enjo yed
reading about one of these t opics in par ticular . If anything, the text suggests that she ma y have found some of these t opics t o be
dull, sa ying that she e ven read the " dry ones"—that is, the boring books—and that some of the books wer e "har d going, " meaning
they wer e diﬃcult t o get thr ough. Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t discuss F rancie ’s inv olvement in other activities,
only her dedication t o reading. Although it’ s possible that F rancie dedicates herself t o reading because she pr efers it t o other
activities, the text doesn ’t indicate whether this is the case. Choice D is incorr ect. Although the text mentions one author (Abbott)
whose book F rancie has r ead as well as se veral topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda v acations, and Byzantine ar chitectur e) she
has encounter ed, the text doesn ’t say whether F rancie admir es any of the books she ’s read so far . Instead, the text focuses on the

ID: cce2f8dc  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most accur ately describes how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. The
ﬁrst sentence of the text intr oduces liter ary scholar Jer emy Douglass’ s warning t o technology inv estors and enthusiasts against
predicting the displacement of conv entional books b y newer media forms. The next sentence, which is underlined in par t, presents
Douglass’ s obser vation that inter activ e texts ar e har dly new; the y have been a vailable for longer than technologists assume,
beginning with the ﬁrst time r eaders wr ote notes in texts’ mar gins. Thus, the function of the underlined por tion is t o challenge the
stance of the technology inv estors and enthusiasts mentioned earlier in the text. As the r emainder of the text points out, newer
media doesn ’t necessarily r eplace older media, but r ather , as Douglass belie ves, leads t o new forms of expr ession.
Choice B is incorr ect because the underlined por tion challenges the position tak en b y inv estors and enthusiasts; it doesn ’t provide
context for their claims. Choice C is incorr ect because the underlined por tion doesn ’t mention academics or compar e them t o

the position of inv estors and enthusiasts who pr edict that conv entional books will be r eplaced b y newer forms of media. Choice D
is incorr ect because the underlined por tion doesn ’t addr ess technological challenges; instead, it disputes the stance tak en b y
investors and enthusiasts, suggesting that conv entional books ha ven’t been displaced b y traditional inter actions with texts, such
as writing in the mar gins, and won ’t be supplanted b y newer forms of media either .

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because based on Text 2, it r epresents how Behr enfeld and colleagues would most lik ely respond t o
the “ conv entional wisdom ” discussed in Text 1. The conv entional wisdom cited holds the opinion that when ther e is species
diversity within a phyt oplankt on population, “ one species should emer ge after outcompeting the r est”—that is, after being so
successful in competing for r esour ces that the other species v anish fr om the population. Howe ver, Text 2 explains that accor ding
to Behr enfeld and colleagues, phyt oplankt on ar e so small and spaced so far apar t in the water that ther e is “ much less” dir ect
competition for r esour ces within phyt oplankt on populations than scientists had pr eviously thought. 
Choice B is incorr ect because Text 2 ne ver discusses whether r outine r eplenishment of ocean nutrients aff ects competition
between phyt oplankt on species. Choice C is incorr ect because the interspecies competition discussed in both texts is speciﬁcally
between phyt oplankt on species, and neither text considers whether phyt oplankt on compete for r esour ces with lar ger

Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “ simply ” most nearly means easily , or inv olving minimal diﬃculty or

nonetheless belie ves it can be eﬃciently arr anged. In other wor ds, the text indicates that one of the supposed beneﬁts of Alice ’s
plan is that it can be easily arr anged.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text describes how Alice ’s plan can be arr anged, and it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that it can be

D. conceal
ID: d3104a68  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of bir dsong. In this context, " diminish "
means r educe or lessen. The text establishes that bir ds sing t o communicate o ver potentially lar ge distances and that r esear chers
belie ve that bir ds that liv e in densely v egetated habitats sing at lower fr equencies than bir ds that liv e in compar atively sparsely
vegetated habitats. The text then explains that r esear chers hold this belief due t o some eff ect of dense v egetation on the distance
that high-fr equency sounds can tr avel. If bir ds sing t o communicate o ver long distances, it would be logical t o conclude that
resear chers belie ve that bir ds in densely v egetated habitats sing at lower fr equencies than bir ds in r elativ ely sparse habitats do
because dense v egetation diminishes the distance that high-fr equency sounds can tr avel.
Choice A is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that dense v egetation can " exceed, " or surpass or go be yond, the
distance that high-fr equency sounds can tr avel. The text suggests that dense v egetation r educes the distance that high-fr equency
sounds can tr avel, not that dense v egetation goes far ther than that distance. Choice C is incorr ect because it would not be
sensible t o sa y that dense v egetation can " encompass, " or enclose or encir cle, the distance that high-fr equency sounds can tr avel.
The distance that sounds can tr avel is not an object that can be enclosed or encir cled b y vegetation. Choice D is incorr ect because
there is no information in the text indicating that dense v egetation can " conceal, " or hide or k eep fr om being obser ved, the distance
that high-fr equency sounds tr avel. Instead, the text suggests that dense v egetation r educes the distance that high-fr equency

Choice A is the best answer . The text star ts by intr oducing a common view among ar chaeologists about the need for an elite class

ID: 5fa165f7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Sam Gilliam ’s artworks. As used in this
context, “ creating” means pr oducing or bringing something int o existence. The text indicates that Gilliam is an ar tist who made
draped canv ases and, later , quilt-lik e paintings. This context suppor ts the idea that Gilliam explor ed diff erent styles in his ar t by
creating special types of paintings.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that Gilliam actually explor ed and pursued the cr eation of quilt-lik e paintings; he
wasn ’t just “ predicting, ” or declaring in adv ance, the existence of these paintings. Choice B is incorr ect because in this context
“refusing” would mean r ejecting, and ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that Gilliam r ejected his quilt-lik e paintings. Instead, the
text indicates that he was exploring and pursuing a new ar t style in these paintings. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context
“hiding” would mean concealing fr om view , and ther e is nothing in the text t o suggest that Gilliam attempted t o conceal his quilt-

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the o verall purpose of the text. The text indicates that "for as

ID: 86fbc64d  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the identiﬁcation of maiz e’s wild
ancest or. In this context, t o "conﬁrm " means t o establish the truth or corr ectness of something. The text explains that maiz e
"shows so little r esemblance t o any wild plant that genetic r esear ch was necessar y" to establish its ancestr y, which was ultimately
traced t o teosinte gr ass. This context conv eys the idea that scientiﬁc v eriﬁcation was r equir ed to establish an ancestr al
relationship with cer tainty—that is, t o conﬁrm teosinte gr ass as maiz e’s ancest or.
Choice A is incorr ect because t o "acquir e" means t o obtain or gain possession of something. Although their r esear ch lik ely
requir ed scientists t o acquir e samples of maiz e and teosinte gr ass, the text does not suggest that this was the ultimate goal of
their work, which instead pr obed the connection between the two plants. Choice B is incorr ect because t o "develop " means t o
create something or t o promote the gr owth of something, and the ancestr al relationship between teosinte gr ass and maiz e alr eady
existed as a biological fact in the deep past, which scientists then v eriﬁed thr ough r esear ch; because this r elationship alr eady
existed, the scientists can ’t be said t o ha ve either cr eated it or encour aged its gr owth. Choice C is incorr ect because t o "attract"

ID: 5444db38  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of using magnetism t o detect str ess in
buried metal pipes. In this context, " exploited" means made pr oductiv e use of. The text indicates that the magnetic ﬁelds of some
metals change under str ess and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible t o measur e those changes fr om a
distance, ther eby demonstr ating that the integrity of under ground metal pipes can be e valuated without ha ving t o unear th them.
This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made pr oductiv e use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals’
magnetic ﬁelds.
Choice A is incorr ect because in this context, "hypothesiz ed" would mean made a tentativ e assumption t o be e valuated in a study
or experiment. Although Saleem and colleagues ma y have had one or mor e hypotheses for these experiments, the text pr esents
the information about the tendency of some metals’ magnetic ﬁelds t o change under str ess as a known fact that the r esear chers
made pr oductiv e use of, not as a hypothesis t o be e valuated. The text after the colon indicates that the r esear chers wer e not
evaluating whether such changes occur but whether those changes can be measur ed at a distance. Choice B is incorr ect because
in this context, " discounted" would mean downpla yed or ignor ed, but the text does not suggest that Saleem and colleagues
minimiz ed or ignor ed the tendency of the magnetic ﬁelds of some metals t o change under str ess. Rather , the text indicates that
this tendency is the basis for Saleem and colleagues’ method of assessing the pipes’ integrity . Choice C is incorr ect because
nothing in the text indicates that Saleem and colleagues "r edeﬁned, " or r eevaluated or r eformulated, the tendency of some metals’

ID: 6017ae31  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Gabriela González and team ’s detection
of gr avitational wa ves. In this context, " ambiguity " means uncer tainty or doubtfulness. The text explains that although sk eptics
had thought that dir ect e vidence of gr avitational wa ves would be t oo faint t o be detected, r esear chers led b y González claimed
that a chirping sound captur ed b y Laser Inter ferometer Gr avitational-W ave Obser vatory antennas ne vertheless pr ovided such
evidence. The text goes on t o sa y that detailed statistical analysis conﬁrmed the obser vation of gr avitational wa ves with a high
degr ee of conﬁdence—that is, with near cer tainty—a ﬁnding that helped t o preclude, or rule out, any claims that the signal’ s
attribution t o gravitational wa ves might be ambiguous or doubtful.
Choice A is incorr ect. In this context, "inconspicuousness" would mean the quality of being unnoticeable or diﬃcult t o detect.
Although the text indicates that sk eptics had doubted whether gr avitational wa ves could be obser ved dir ectly because of their
presumed faintness (which suggests that gr avitational wa ves wer e expected t o be diﬃcult t o detect), the blank por tion of the text
isn’t referring t o the possibility that gr avitational wa ves ar e unnoticeable or undetectable. Instead, the focus of the last sentence is
González’ s team ’s obser vation of a chirping sound that the y attributed t o gravitational wa ves, and it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y
that thr ough statistical analysis, the y ruled out the possibility that the sound the y obser ved was undetectable. Rather , the sk eptical
view pr esented in the text suggests that ther e could be some ambiguity about the sour ce of the chirping, but statistical analysis
virtually eliminated this uncer tainty . Choice B is incorr ect because in this context, " discr etion " would mean good judgment, and it
wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that an e vent, such as the detection of gr avitational wa ves, would show judgment, much less that the
event’s capacity t o exercise good judgment would be pr ecluded b y statistical analysis conﬁrming its attribution. Choice D is
incorr ect because in this context, " probability " would mean lik elihood, and the text states that statistical analysis, which conﬁrmed
the signal with a high degr ee of conﬁdence, suggests the lik elihood that the chirping sound was pr oduced b y gravitational wa ves,
not that the analysis helped t o preclude this lik elihood.

Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the author ’s claim about the r elationship

Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o refer to the author ’s claim as “ disorienting, ” or confusing. The

the narr ator’s earlier char acterization of Dot. The underlined sentence thus off ers a detail that shows how Dot is gr owing str onger .
Choice B is incorr ect. While a sentence earlier in the text mentions Celestine ’s psy chological state (sadness because Dot is
growing fast), the underlined sentence doesn ’t focus on Celestine at all. Instead, the sentence focuses on Dot’ s physical activities
to show that she is getting str onger . Choice C is incorr ect because the underlined sentence describes Dot’ s beha vior, not the

an earlier sentence in the text mentions that Celestine is sad, the underlined sentence doesn ’t focus on how Celestine f eels nor

ID: dba9eaf8  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of baleen whale accessor y spleens. In this
context, “latent” means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contr ast between the idea that baleen whale accessor y
spleens appear not t o ha ve a function and the r esear ch indicating that the accessor y spleen ma y actually ha ve a r ole in suppor ting
the whales’ diving mechanisms. This context ther efore conv eys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessor y spleens
are latent ma y be incorr ect.
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that the r ole of the accessor y spleen is “r eplicable, ” or capable of
being r eproduced. The text indicates that the r ole of the accessor y spleen seems t o ha ve no function, but some r esear chers think
it does ha ve a r ole; the text doesn ’t addr ess whether the r ole of the accessor y spleen could or couldn ’t be r eproduced. Choice B is
incorr ect because suggesting that the r ole of the accessor y spleen is “ predetermined, ” or decided in adv ance, wouldn ’t mak e
sense in context. Although the r esear chers ma y agr ee that the r ole of the accessor y spleen or any other or gan hasn ’t been
determined in adv ance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessor y spleen was thought t o ha ve been functionless but ma y in
fact ser ve an activ e role for baleen whales. Choice C is incorr ect because it’ s the opposite of what the context of the text is

Empir e. The text also states that tr ade between the pr ovince and the capital r equir ed “a long o verland journe y.” This context
suggests that X oconochco was situated t owar d an edge of the empir e’s territ ory rather than near its center .
Choice A is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense in context t o refer to Xoconochco ’s location within the A ztec Empir e as
“unobtrusiv e,” or not blatant or undesir ably pr ominent; it’ s not clear how a pr ovince ’s physical location would or wouldn ’t be blatant.
Instead of focusing on how noticeable X oconochco ’s location was, the text emphasiz es the pr ovince ’s distance fr om the capital of
the empir e, pointing out that because of this distance tr ade between the two r equir ed “a long o verland journe y.” Choice B is
incorr ect because the text indicates that the pr ovince of X oconochco was located on a coast far fr om the capital of the A ztec
Empir e, not that it was “ concealed, ” or k ept out of sight or hidden fr om view . Nothing in the text suggests that X oconochco was
actually hidden such that people couldn ’t see it, and being hidden wouldn ’t necessarily r esult in tr ade between the pr ovince and the
capital r equiring “ a long o verland journe y.” Choice C is incorr ect because t o sa y that X oconochco ’s location within the A ztec
Empir e was “ appr oximate ” would mean that the location either wasn ’t precisely corr ect or was close t o some other location.
Neither of these meanings would mak e sense in context because the text indicates that X oconochco ’s location is known and that

A. antecedent
B. impending
C. innocuous
D. perpetual
ID: 0ed8f24f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of adv ance indications of solar ﬂar es. In this
context the wor d "impending" means imminent or appr oaching. The text mentions a study b y Leka and colleagues that found that
the Sun ’s cor ona pr ovides an adv ance indication of solar ﬂar es. The text then points out why such an adv ance indication would be
useful—solar ﬂar es can inter fere with communications on Ear th—and concludes b y describing the char acteristic of the cor ona that
gives warning of a solar ﬂar e. The text indicates that this char acteristic—incr eased brightness in a par ticular r egion of the cor ona
—comes befor e the appear ance of the ﬂar e. Ther efore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the ﬂar e is appr oaching, or
impending.
Choice A is incorr ect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the incr eased brightness of the Sun ’s cor ona pr ecedes the
appear ance of the ﬂar e. But if the ﬂar e wer e "antecedent, " or pr evious, then the ﬂar e would instead pr ecede the appear ance of the
increased brightness of the cor ona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorr ect. The wor d "innocuous, " or
harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar ﬂar es can inter fere with communications on Ear th, the y cannot
reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorr ect. If the solar ﬂar es ha ve an adv ance indication of their appear ance,
then ther e must ther efore be a time befor e the appear ance of the ﬂar es when the y do not exist. But the wor d "perpetual, " or ne ver-
ending, would in context indicate that the ﬂar e exists at the same time as the adv ance indication pr ovided b y the Sun ’s cor ona,
which would not mak e logical sense.

Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it r eﬂects how the author of Text 2 would most lik ely respond t o the underlined claim about
the Clo vis people in Text 1. Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clo vis people wer e the ﬁrst human inhabitants of Nor th America
has been o verturned b y the unear thing of st one t ools in Chiquihuite Ca ve in Mexico. The t ools wer e found in a la yer of ear th that is
over 33,000 y ears old—much older than the Clo vis people ’s arriv al 13,000 y ears ago. The text ends with the claim that the t ools
reveal that humans liv ed in the ca ve long befor e the Clo vis people r eached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the
idea that the st one pieces ar e deﬁnitely t ools. Text 2 states that the pieces ar e so r oughly shaped that the y ma y have simply
natur ally br oken off fr om r ocks and, mor eover, that no other signs of human activity ha ve been found in the ca ve. In other wor ds,
Text 2 ar gues that ther e is no pr oof y et that humans made the pieces as t ools or wer e even pr esent in the ca ve. Ther efore, the
author of Text 2 would most lik ely sa y that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Ca ve long befor e the Clo vis people
reached Nor th America r ests on an assumption about the st one pieces—that the y are human-made t ools—that is not suﬃciently
suppor ted b y available e vidence.
Choice A is incorr ect because Text 1 doesn ’t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Ca ve and the Clo vis people had any
connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each gr oup’s presence in Nor th America. F urther, the author of Text
2 mak es no mention of the Clo vis people and indicates that it isn ’t clear y et that any human gr oup did inhabit Chiquihuite Ca ve.
Choice C is incorr ect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author belie ves the st one pieces pr obably ar e human-made t ools
and will be conﬁrmed as such b y fur ther analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasiz es the curr ent lack of e vidence of human

ID: 03eeecf3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined por tion in the text as a whole. In the text, the
speak er mentions the occurr ence in natur e of seedpods being shak en b y a slight wind. The speak er then goes on t o compar e the
black seeds t o thoughts, using language that indicates that the speak er’s state of mind is unsettled (e.g., " my thoughts ar e spent";
"My thoughts tear me, I dr ead their f ever"). The text concludes with a comparison between the speak er’s "scatter ed" state of mind
and the "hot shriv elled seeds. " Thus, the underlined por tion of the text pr esents an obser vation of an occurr ence in the natur al
world that the speak er then expands on t o conv ey a sense of a turbulent interior state.
Choice A is incorr ect because the text does not indicate that the seedpods ar e the cause of the speak er’s state of mind; thus, the y
could not be r esponsible for any misgivings the speak er has. Choice B is incorr ect because the text does not contr ast the natur al
landscape with the speak er’s state of mind or describe the wind shaking the seedpods as consistent; r ather , the text suggests that
the state of the natur al world and the speak er’s state of mind ar e similar in that both ar e unsettled. Choice D is incorr ect because
there is no indication in the text that the speak er regularly engages in critical self-e valuation, only that in this par ticular instance
the speak er’s state of mind is turbulent.

Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of how biodiv ersity loss due t o inv asive
species can be a voided. As used in this context, “ preventable ” means able t o be st opped or k ept fr om happening. The text
indicates that “ people can tak e simple steps” t o avoid bringing possible inv asive species int o new envir onments. It pr esents these
steps as an example of how biodiv ersity loss due t o inv asive species is pr eventable.
Choice B is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t mak e sense t o sa y that a simple step lik e washing y our shoes after tr aveling is an
example of biodiv ersity loss due t o inv asive species being “undeniable, ” or something that can ’t be pr oved to be wr ong. Although
the text ma y suggest that biodiv ersity loss due t o inv asive species is something that r eally happens, the wor d that completes the
text must mak e the ﬁrst sentence int o an asser tion that is illustr ated b y the second sentence, and the second sentence illustr ates
the idea that biodiv ersity loss due t o inv asive species is pr eventable, not undeniable. Choice C is incorr ect because it wouldn ’t
mak e sense t o sa y that a simple step lik e washing y our shoes after tr aveling is an example of biodiv ersity loss due t o inv asive
species being “ common, ” or something that happens r egularly . Additionally , the text doesn ’t provide any information about how

A team led b y Bernar do Str assbur g has found that r ewilding farmland (r eturning the land t o its natur al state) could help pr eser ve
biodiv ersity and offset carbon emissions. The amount of farmland that would need t o be r estored, the y found, is r emarkably low .
Rewilding a mer e 15% of the world’ s curr ent farmland would pr event 60% of expected species extinctions and help absorb nearly
299 gigat ons of carbon dio xide—a clear win in the ﬁght against the biodiv ersity and climate crises.

Choice A is the best answer . Text 1 is extr emely positiv e about Str assbur g’s team ’s ﬁndings, calling the potential r esults " a clear
win in the ﬁght against the biodiv ersity and climate crises. " Text 2 is not as positiv e, arguing that while the ﬁndings point t o
"potential beneﬁts, " we also need t o consider the " potential eff ects on global food supplies. "
Choice B is incorr ect. This isn ’t a diff erence between the two views. Text 1 does pr esent the 15% number as enough t o achie ve

Neither text mentions the timeline for achie ving the r esults described b y Str assbur g’s team. Choice D is incorr ect. This isn ’t a

ID: ad4f7362  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the main purpose of the text, which is t o for eground Queen
Dido ’s str ong emotional r esponse t o Aeneas’ s story. Throughout, the text emphasiz es how deeply the queen is aff ected b y both
Aeneas’ s tale and persona. A t the outset, the speak er explicitly states that " anxious car es...seiz’ d the queen " and then uses the
metaphor of ﬁr e ("within her v eins a ﬂame unseen " and " secr et ﬁr e") to evoke the warmth of Dido ’s feelings for Aeneas. In addition,
the line "His wor ds, his looks, imprinted in her hear t" suggests the deep impr ession that Aeneas’ s story mak es on Dido, eliciting
passion for him ("impr ov[ing] the passion ") and empathy for his suff ering ("incr eas[ing] the smar t").
Choice A is incorr ect because ther e’s no indication in the text that Dido is sk eptical of Aeneas’ s account, much less that she ’s
trying t o conceal that sk epticism. On the contr ary, the text shows her being mo ved b y his wor ds and de veloping f eelings for him.
Choice C is incorr ect. While the text mentions that Dido is impr essed b y Aeneas’ s "valor, acts, and bir th," which might suggest (but
doesn ’t necessarily entail) intellectual engagement, the text doesn ’t represent Dido ’s engagement with Aeneas in a manner that
suggests a balance between emotion and intellect. Rather , the text primarily emphasiz es her emotional r esponse—speciﬁcally her
attraction t o Aeneas and her emotional inv estment in his st ory, indicating that his "v alor, acts, and bir th inspir e / Her soul with lo ve,
and fan the secr et ﬁr e" and that his wor ds and looks elicit passion and empathy . Choice D is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t
suggest that Dido is worried about Aeneas disco vering a secr et she is concealing fr om him. Though the text begins b y mentioning
Dido ’s "anxious car es," this r efers t o her gr owing passion for Aeneas and pity for his suff ering, not t o worr y about a secr et she is
concealing. The text’ s reference t o a "ﬂame unseen " and " secr et ﬁr e" points t o Dido ’s growing f eelings for Aeneas that de velop as
he recounts his tale, not t o a secr et that existed befor e their encounter; mor eover, the text pr ovides no indication that Dido is
worried Aeneas might disco ver these f eelings.

The 1967 r elease of Har old Cruse ’s book The Crisis of the Negr o Intellectual isolated him fr om almost all other scholars and
activists of the American Civil Rights Mo vement—though many of those think ers disagr eed with each other , he nonetheless found
ways to disagr ee with them all. He thought that activists who belie ved that Black people such as himself should cultur ally
assimilate wer e naïv e. But he also sharply criticiz ed Black nationalists such as Mar cus Gar vey who wanted t o establish
independent, self-contained Black economies and societies, e ven though Cruse himself identiﬁed as a Black nationalist.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A. It describes a dir ection that Cruse f elt the Civil Rights Mo vement ought t o tak e.
B. It indicates that Cruse ’s reputation as a persistent antagonist of other scholars is undeser ved.
C. It describes a contr oversy that Cruse ’s work caused within the Black nationalist mo vement.
D. It helps explain Cruse ’s position with r espect t o the community of civil rights think ers.
ID: 9b01bcf4  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The text as a whole claims that Cruse disagr eed with vir tually all other Civil Rights scholars and
activists. The underlined sentence describes one wa y that Cruse both did and didn ’t ﬁt in with those think ers: he criticiz ed Black
nationalists, e ven though he identiﬁed as one.
Choice A is incorr ect. The underlined sentence doesn ’t do this. It describes Cruse ’s criticisms—it ne ver mentions what Cruse did
want the mo vement t o do instead. Choice B is incorr ect. This conﬂicts with the text, which ar gues that Cruse did disagr ee with
almost all other scholars of the Civil Rights Mo vement. Choice C is incorr ect. This is a step t oo far . The text ne ver sa ys that Cruse ’s
work caused contr oversy within the Black nationalist mo vement.

Text 1
Polar bears sustain themselv es primarily b y hunting seals on the Ar ctic sea ice, but rising ocean temper atures ar e causing the ice
to diminish, r aising concerns about polar bear population declines as these lar ge pr edat ors’ seal-hunting habitats continue t o
shrink. A 2020 study examining polar bear populations acr oss the Ar ctic concluded that populations aff ected b y sea-ice loss ar e
at gr eat risk of extinction b y the end of the twenty-ﬁrst centur y.
Text 2
Monit oring carried out b y resear chers fr om the Nor wegian P olar Institute shows that the polar bear population on the Ar ctic
archipelago of Sv albar d remains stable and well nourished despite r apidly declining sea ice in r ecent y ears. The r esear chers
attribute this population ’s resilience in par t to a shift in f eeding str ategies: in addition t o hunting seals, the Sv albar d polar bears
have begun r elying on a diet of r eindeer meat and bir ds’ eggs.
Based on the texts, how would the r esear chers in Text 2 most lik ely respond t o the conclusion pr esented in the underlined por tion
of Text 1?
A. By noting that it neglects the possibility of some polar bear populations adapting t o changes in their envir onment
B. By suggesting that it is lik ely incorr ect about the r ates at which warming ocean temper atures ha ve caused sea ice t o melt in
the Ar ctic
C. By asser ting that it o verlooks polar bear populations that ha ve not y et been aff ected b y loss of seal-hunting habitats
D. By ar guing that it fails t o account for polar bears’ r eliance on a single seal-hunting str ategy
ID: f52cc78c  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . Text 2 describes how the Sv albar d polar bears ha ve adapted t o the loss of sea ice b y div ersifying their
diet and f eeding on r eindeer and seabir d eggs, r esulting in a “ stable and well nourished” population despite envir onmental
challenges. This counters the underlined claim that polar bears facing a loss of sea ice ar e at “ great risk of extinction ” by the end
of the centur y.
Choice B is incorr ect. Text 2 does not challenge the fact that sea ice is r apidly declining in the Ar ctic due t o warming ocean
temper atures. In fact, it states that the Sv albar d polar bears ha ve faced “r apidly declining sea ice in r ecent y ears. ” Choice C is
incorr ect. The claim in Text 1 is speciﬁc t o polar bear populations aff ected b y the loss of seal hunting habitats, so unaff ected
populations ar e irrelevant t o the claim. Also, Text 2 doesn ’t mention any polar bear populations that ha ven’t yet been aff ected b y
loss of seal hunting habitats. It focuses on a population that has been aff ected b y sea-ice loss but has managed t o sur vive and
thriv e nevertheless. Choice D is incorr ect. Text 2 doesn ’t imply that polar bears r ely on a single seal-hunting str ategy . In fact, the
resear cher in Text 2 would sa y that Text 1 fails t o account for polar bears’ ability t o de velop other hunting str ategies and food
sour ces.

A. deriv ed fr om
B. recogniz ed in
C. conﬁned t o
D. repressed b y
ID: 8634bf4a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of the ar tist Diego V elázquez’ s inﬂuence outside
Spain. As used in this context, “ conﬁned t o” means r estricted t o. The text sa ys that V elázquez was the leading ar tist in the Spanish
cour t during the se venteenth centur y, but it also notes that other painters ar ound the world wer e inﬂuenced b y his techniques and
style. Thus, V elázquez’ s inﬂuence was har dly (or almost not) conﬁned t o, or r estricted t o, Spain.
Choice A is incorr ect because if V elázquez was a leading ar tist in Spain, it doesn ’t mak e logical sense t o claim that his inﬂuence
was har dly (or almost not) deriv ed fr om, or obtained fr om, Spain. Mor eover, the other painters ar ound the world who emplo yed
Velázquez’ s techniques would b y deﬁnition be inﬂuenced b y Spanish style. Choice B is incorr ect because if V elázquez was a
leading ar tist in the cour t of King Philip IV of Spain, then his inﬂuence must ha ve been widely r ecogniz ed, or acknowledged, r ather
than being har dly (or almost not) r ecogniz ed. Choice D is incorr ect because the text giv es no indication that deliber ately limiting
Velázquez’ s inﬂuence outside Spain was e ver consider ed b y any one. Thus, e ven if it is true that his inﬂuence was not r epressed, or
restrained, it doesn ’t mak e logical sense t o sa y so in this context.

D. To explain how Joplin learned t o compose and per form r agtime music
ID: 1090b367  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is t o mak e a case for the impor tance of
Scott Joplin ’s less famous works. The text begins b y intr oducing Joplin ’s most popular works and then goes on t o asser t that
gaining a full understanding of Joplin ’s creativity r equir es a consider ation of his lesser-known pieces as well. The text concludes
by char acterizing the lesser-known works "Pleasant Moments" and Treemonisha  as masterpieces that deser ve to be famous.
These details indicate that the text’ s main purpose is t o argue that mor e attention should be giv en to Joplin ’s lesser-known works.
Choice A is incorr ect. Although the text discusses some of the r agtime music and an oper a that Joplin composed, it does not
compar e the two types of music in gener al. Instead, the text ar gues that Joplin ’s lesser-known works, including his oper a, deser ve
as much attention as his mor e famous r agtime pieces r eceiv e. Choice C is incorr ect because the text discusses only Joplin ’s
music and does not ask music lo vers t o listen t o a v ariety of composers. Instead, the text encour ages listeners t o pa y attention t o
Joplin ’s lesser-known works in or der t o gain a full understanding of his cr eativity . Choice D is incorr ect because the text does not
discuss how Joplin learned t o compose and per form r agtime music. Instead, the text focuses on Joplin ’s less famous works and
mak es a case for their impor tance.

ID: 40270820  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it most accur ately describes the o verall structur e of the text. The text begins b y mentioning
Catherine L. Car delús, " a resear cher who studies canop y soil. " The text then pr ovides information about her chosen r esear ch topic:
the formation of canop y soil in tr ee br anches, the r ole of canop y soil in pr eser ving a healthy water cy cle in r ainfor ests, and
Cardelús’ s speciﬁc inter est in "the canop y soils in lar ge choibá tr ees in r ainfor ests in Costa Rica. " Thus, the text intr oduces a

Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t mention any disagr eement between r esear chers, nor does it describe how such a

D. imagine
ID: b507f90f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latr o, the main char acter in Gene W olfe’s no vel
Soldier of the Mist . In this context, " preser ve" means sa ve or k eep fr om destruction or loss. The text describes Latr o as a char acter
who loses his memor y whene ver he sleeps. The text goes on t o explain that befor e going t o sleep, Latr o recor ds his most
impor tant memories t o prevent him fr om for getting, or losing, them. The context ther efore suppor ts the idea that Latr o recor ds his
most impor tant experiences in an effor t to sa ve, or pr eser ve, his memor y of them fr om loss.
Choice A is incorr ect because " suspect" would mean mistrust, which wouldn ’t mak e sense in this context. The text emphasiz es
that in writing down his experiences, Latr o car efully chooses those which ar e most impor tant t o him and thus wor th remembering
later , not that he is mistrustful or has r eason t o doubt the experiences he r ecor ds. Choice C is incorr ect because in this context,
"suggest" would mean pr opose for consider ation. The text emphasiz es the fact that Latr o actually r ecor ds those experiences that
he has decided ar e most impor tant t o him, not that he mer ely pr oposes which experiences t o consider for inclusion in his scr oll.
Choice D is incorr ect because in this context, "imagine " would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which
would logically complete the text. Although it’ s possible that r eviewing r ecor ds fr om pr evious da ys might enable Latr o to
reconstruct mental images of what has happened t o him in the past, the text emphasiz es the fact that Latr o car efully selects and
writes down his experiences so he will r emember them in the futur e, not so that he can form mental pictur es of them as he writes
them down. In a similar v ein, the text emphasiz es that Latr o is r ecor ding experiences that ha ve actually happened t o him, not that
he’s fabricating the experiences he r ecor ds.

ID: dcd9ad50  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the o verall structur e of the text. The ﬁrst par t of the text pr esents the
favorable opinions that others hold of Mr . Ely: the laity of Milb y regar d him as ha ving "r emarkable powers and learning" and
assume that he also impr esses people in London, while his f ellow cler gy see him as " a discr eet and agr eeable f ellow ." The text
then goes on t o describe Mr . Ely’s beha viors that enable him t o cultiv ate and pr eser ve his positiv e reputation. The text conv eys
that he a voids confr ontations, abstaining fr om " warm discussion[s]" (that is, heated or contentious ones); that he a voids off ending
anyone b y "rarely [sa ying] what he thought himself " and b y refraining fr om openly ridiculing any one; and that he doesn ’t giv e
anyone any r eason t o ridicule or belittle his own char acter ("he ne ver ga ve any one an oppor tunity of laughing at him"). In other
words, these ar e all beha viors that suggest that Mr . Ely a voids doing anything that might mak e people dislik e him or think poorly of
him. Thus, the text begins b y presenting the fa vorable view that people ha ve of Mr . Ely and then describes the beha viors that
enable him t o maintain that fa vorable view .
Choice A is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t describe any e vents that caused people ’s regar d for Mr . Ely t o diminish. Instead, the
text explains that the people of Milb y hold him in high r egar d and describes beha viors that suggest how he cultiv ates that r egar d.
Choice B is incorr ect because the text doesn ’t suggest that Mr . Ely’s neighbors ar e mor e naïv e than Londoners ar e or that the y’ve
been misled. Although the text suggests that Mr . Ely is v ery guar ded in his outwar d beha vior and conceals fr om people when he
may be internally mocking them, which might suggest that people know him less well than the y think the y do, ther e’s nothing in the
text t o suggest that Londoners ar e less naïv e and ther efore less easily misled than Mr . Ely’s neighbors ar e. The text states that the
people of Milb y belie ve Mr . Ely t o be "r emarkable " and that the y assume that people in London must ﬁnd him so, t oo; it doesn ’t say
anything about what Londoners actually think of him. Choice C is incorr ect. While the text discusses Mr . Ely’s public conduct at

Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, " mingled" most nearly means combined. In the text, the speak er refers t o

of a str ange ﬂower). This comparison conv eys that the speak er views the concepts of lo ve, April, and the gold of someone ’s hair

Choice A is incorr ect because " mingled" means combined, not identiﬁed. The speak er names se veral concepts (lo ve, April, and the

text as a whole ma y refer to a memor y, but the comparison of the mingling of se veral concepts (lo ve, April, and the gold color of

Choice B is the best answer because it accur ately describes how the underlined por tion functions in the text as a whole. In the
text, the narr ator explains that she walks ar ound her neighborhood, making a " mental map " of the ar ea that she imagines herself
navigating thr ough. She then states that she r ehearses "the small world’ s scheme "—that is, imagines mo ving thr ough her mental

challenges (getting t o the st ore thr ough backy ards and tr aveling fr om school t o a friend’ s house) and thus pr ovides examples of
what the narr ator thinks about at night.
Choice A is incorr ect because the underlined por tion mak es no mention of memorizing a telephone number . Although the narr ator
mentions that she had t o learn the home telephone number befor e her mother would giv e her permission t o walk ar ound the

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of the study of f emale par ticipation in
hunting among pr ehist oric peoples. In this context, “ negligible ” means not signiﬁcant enough t o be wor th considering. The text
says that the study challenged the accepted view of f emale par ticipation in hunting among pr ehist oric peoples. The text goes on
to sa y that the r esear chers found that “in fact, as many as half ” the hunters in the gr oups studied wer e female. The phr ase “in fact”
establishes a contr ast indicating that the ﬁnding that as many as half the hunters wer e female diff ers fr om the accepted view . This
context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that f emale par ticipation in hunting was negligible. 
Choice A is incorr ect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view b y showing that as many as half of
hunters among pr ehist oric peoples wer e female, which suggests that the accepted view is that f emale par ticipation was low , not
that f emale par ticipation was “ine vitable, ” or una voidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is that pr ehist oric
peoples could not a void f emale par ticipation in hunting. Choice B is incorr ect because nothing in the text suggests that the
accepted view of f emale par ticipation in hunting among pr ehist oric peoples is that such par ticipation was “ satisfact ory,” or
suﬃcient t o meet a r equir ement or demand. Ther e is no information in the text about any demands or r equir ements r egar ding
female par ticipation in hunting, let alone any information about how much f emale par ticipation in hunting would be enough t o
satisfy those demands or r equir ements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view b y showing that as
many as half the hunters in the gr oups studied wer e female, suggesting that the accepted view is that f emale par ticipation in
hunting was low . Choice D is incorr ect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view b y showing that as
many as half of hunters among the pr ehist oric peoples studied wer e female, which suggests that the accepted view is that f emale
participation was low , not that f emale par ticipation was “ commonplace, ” or or dinar y or unr emarkable. Although the study under

Choice A is incorr ect because in this context “ experiment with ” would mean t o do something new with. Although using mot ors

A. distinct
B. requir ed
C. unintended
D. unknown
ID: 2390e956  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’ s discussion of Rony oung Kim ’s no vel Clay Walls. In this
context, " distinct" means clearly separ ate and diff erent. The text indicates that the no vel consists of thr ee sections and that each
section is narr ated fr om the perspectiv e of a diff erent char acter . This context suppor ts the idea that Kim ’s no vel featur es thr ee
distinct perspectiv es.
Choice B is incorr ect because describing the thr ee perspectiv es in Kim ’s no vel as "r equir ed," or demanded as necessar y to be done
or pr ovided, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. When writing a no vel, a no velist is fr ee to choose t o narr ate the st ory from any
number of perspectiv es. Ther e’s nothing in the text t o indicate that pr oviding thr ee perspectiv es was demanded of Kim. Instead,
the text focuses on identifying the thr ee diff erent perspectiv es featur ed in Kim ’s no vel. Choice C is incorr ect because describing
the thr ee perspectiv es in Kim ’s no vel as "unintended, " or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context.
Authors mak e deliber ate choices about the perspectiv es the y featur e in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose t o
incorpor ate thr ee diff erent perspectiv es in her no vel. Choice D is incorr ect because describing the thr ee perspectiv es in Kim ’s
novel as "unknown, " or not r evealed, wouldn ’t mak e sense in context. The text dir ectly identiﬁes the thr ee perspectiv es that appear
in her no vel as those of F aye and her two par ents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the no vel’s perspectiv es ar e in fact

Choice A is incorr ect because " speciﬁcally " illogically signals that the information in this sentence pr ovides speciﬁc, pr ecise

accomplishing a goal established in the pr evious sentence about the prime meridian ’s establishment. Instead, the sentence
indicates that incr easingly pr ecise coor dinates wer e revealed on multiple occasions in the decades following the meridian ’s
establishment. Choice D is incorr ect because " granted" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is in opposition t o
the information about the prime meridian ’s establishment in the pr evious sentence. Instead, the sentence indicates that

ID: 54227b8e  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The sentence deﬁnes the term "Lazarus species" and pr ovides an example of one, explaining that a
Lazarus species is a living or ganism that was once belie ved to be extinct and pr oviding the mountain p ygmy possum as an
example.
Choice B is incorr ect. While the sentence pr ovides an example of a Lazarus species, it doesn ’t deﬁne the term "Lazarus species. "
Choice C is incorr ect. The sentence pr ovides information about the mountain p ygmy possum; it doesn ’t deﬁne the term "Lazarus
species" or explicitly identify the mountain p ygmy possum as a Lazarus species. Choice D is incorr ect. While the sentence
describes the concept of a Lazarus species, it doesn ’t deﬁne the term or pr ovide an example of a Lazarus species.

Choice B is the best answer . “Previously ” logically signals that the fused ﬁber theor y came befor e Ramón y Cajal’ s disco very.
Choice A is incorr ect. “Howe ver” illogically signals that the fused ﬁber theor y in this sentence contr asts with the information in the

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The sentence explains an adv antage of Tang and his colleagues’ platinum catalyst, noting that it
requir es far less platinum (which is r are and expensiv e) than other platinum catalysts do.
Choice A is incorr ect. The sentence describes the platinum catalyst that Tang and his colleagues cr eated; it doesn ’t explain an

Choice A is incorr ect. The sentence deﬁnes two terms associated with le vers; it doesn ’t contr ast ﬁrst-class le vers and second-
class le vers. Choice B is incorr ect. While the sentence seems t o acknowledge a gener al diff erence in fulcrum and load locations
between ﬁrst-class and second-class le vers, it does not specify what this diff erence is. Mor eover, the sentence could be r ead as
emphasizing a similarity—that in both types of le vers, the fulcrum and load ar e in diff erent locations. The sentence thus fails t o

The conf erence famously f eatur ed a debate between physicists Alber t Einstein and Niels Bohr .
Bohr pr oposed that subat omic entities lik e electr ons had only pr obable r ealities until the y wer e obser ved.

British scholar Rober t Plot described fossiliz ed dinosaur bones in his 1676 book The Natur al Hist ory of Oxfor dshir e.
Plot earned a r eputation for being the ﬁrst person t o ha ve disco vered dinosaur r emains.
In 1990, ar chaeologists in Lesotho, in southern Africa, disco vered a fossiliz ed phalanx of a Massospondylus carinatus

A. Benoit challenged Plot’ s reputation for being the ﬁrst person t o ha ve disco vered M. carinatus  remains.
B. Evidence that Khoesan and Basotho peoples ma y have found an M. carinatus  phalanx as long ago as 1100 CE suggests that

ID: 3fa48bf3  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . Noting that the e vidence suggests Indigenous peoples ma y have found dinosaur r emains in 1100 CE,
the sentence emphasiz es how the 1990 disco very challenged Plot’ s reputation as the ﬁrst person t o disco ver dinosaur r emains.
Choice A is incorr ect. While the sentence does emphasiz e that Benoit challenged Plot’ s reputation, it misr epresents information in
the notes; Plot was r eputed t o be the ﬁrst person t o disco ver dinosaur r emains in gener al, not the ﬁrst person t o disco ver M.
carinatus  remains speciﬁcally . Choice C is incorr ect. The sentence only par tially explains the signiﬁcance of the 1990 disco very,
noting that it suggests Indigenous people br ought dinosaur r emains t o the ca ve in 1100 CE; it doesn ’t explain the disco very’s
signiﬁcance t o Plot’ s reputation. Choice D is incorr ect. While the sentence does emphasiz e that the disco very challenged Plot’ s
reputation, it misr epresents information in the notes. The notes don ’t indicate that the 1990 disco very cast any doubt on Plot’ s
claims t o ha ve found fossiliz ed dinosaur bones; r ather , the disco very challenged Plot’ s reputation for being the ﬁrst t o disco ver

When one looks at the dark cr aggy vistas in Hit oshi F ugo’s evocativ e phot o series, one ’s mind might wander off t o the cr atered
surfaces of far away planets. ______  it’s the series’ title, Flying F rying P an, that brings one back t o Ear th, reminding the viewer that
each phot o is actually a close-up view of a familiar household object: a fr ying pan.
Which choice completes the text with the most logical tr ansition?
A. Consequently ,
B. Alternativ ely,
C. Ultimately ,
D. Additionally ,
ID: 6e0c60da  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The ﬁrst sentence describes an experience that the viewer has when the y’re looking at the phot os:
they imagine other planets. This sentence describes an experience that the viewer has after ward: the title r eminds them that the
phot os ar e of fr ying pans, bringing them back t o reality . “Ultimately ” is a tr ansition that means “ eventually ” or “in the end, ” so it ﬁts
the context per fectly .
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice uses a cause-and-eff ect tr ansition, which doesn ’t mak e sense her e. The viewer imagining other
planets when the y’re looking at the phot os doesn ’t cause the title t o bring them back t o reality . Choice B is incorr ect. This choice
uses a tr ansition that indicates another option or possibility , which doesn ’t mak e sense her e. Rather , the viewer has both
experiences: ﬁrst the viewer imagines that the y’re looking at another planet, and then the title r eminds them that it’ s just a fr ying
pan. Choice D is incorr ect. This choice uses a tr ansition that indicates the addition of an agr eeing idea. But the viewer ’s experience
in the second sentence is actually the opposite of the viewer ’s experience in the ﬁrst sentence. In the ﬁrst sentence, the viewer is
imagining that the y’re seeing a landscape fr om another planet. In the second sentence, the viewer is r eminded that the y’re looking
at a fr ying pan.

that McNeil, who became the k eeper at Bridgepor t Breakwater Light in 1904, began her car eer y ears after Y ounghans, who
became the k eeper at Bilo xi Light in 1867.
Choice A is incorr ect because it mak es a gener alization about the eff ects of McNeil’ s and Y ounghans’ s work; it doesn ’t emphasiz e

Choice A is the best answer . "As a r esult" logically signals that the information in the sentence—that, in the US House of

Choice B is incorr ect because "instead" illogically signals that Alaska ha ving just one state district is an alternativ e to the

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The sentence emphasiz es the number of islands in K omodo National P ark that ha ve Komodo
dragons living on them, noting that four of the park’ s twenty-nine islands ha ve Komodo dr agons.
Choice A is incorr ect. While the sentence does explain that K omodo dr agons liv e on the islands of K omodo National P ark, it
doesn ’t emphasiz e how many of those islands K omodo dr agons liv e on. Choice B is incorr ect. The sentence explains that K omodo
National P ark contains the world’ s lar gest lizar ds; it doesn ’t identify these lizar ds as K omodo dr agons or emphasiz e how many of
the park’ s islands the lizar ds liv e on. Choice D is incorr ect. The sentence speciﬁes the t otal number of islands in K omodo National

Choice A is the best answer . This choice intr oduces W ong and VGHS  in an activ e and speciﬁc wa y, as if t o an audience unfamiliar

Choice B is incorr ect. This choice isn ’t suited for beginning a narr ative. A narr ative is a st ory that follows a sequence of e vents and
creates inter est and suspense for the r eader . This choice jumps t o the end, explaining the success of VGHS  without explaining

Choice B is the best answer . "For this r eason " logically signals that the r eason Joseph Priestle y termed o xygen " dephlogisticated
air" was that he accepted the theor y mentioned in the pr evious sentence—that the pr esence of phlogist on, r ather than the absence
of oxygen, causes ﬁr e in a closed container t o go out.
Choice A is incorr ect because "in other wor ds" illogically signals that the information about Priestle y terming o xygen
"dephlogisticated air " is a r estatement of the pr evious theor y concerning phlogist on. Instead, Priestle y chose the term as a r esult

an alternativ e to the pr evious theor y concerning phlogist on. Instead, Priestle y chose the term as a r esult of this theor y. Choice D is
incorr ect because " nevertheless" illogically signals that Priestle y termed o xygen " dephlogisticated air " despite the pr evious theor y

While r esear ching a t opic, a student has tak en the following notes:
Planetar y scientists classify aster oids based on their composition.
C-type aster oids ar e composed primarily of carbon.
They account for r oughly 75 per cent of known aster oids.
S-type aster oids ar e primarily made up of silicate miner als.
They account for r oughly 17 per cent of known aster oids.
The student wants t o emphasiz e a diff erence between C-type and S-type aster oids. Which choice most eff ectiv ely uses r elevant
information fr om the notes t o accomplish this goal? 
A. Planetar y scientists classify aster oids int o types, two of which ar e the C-type and the S-type.
B. Planetar y scientists consider an aster oid’s composition (such as whether the aster oid is composed mainly of silicate miner als
or carbon) when classifying it.
C. Roughly 17 per cent of known aster oids ar e classiﬁed as S-type aster oids; another per centage is classiﬁed as C-type aster oids. 
D. C-type aster oids ar e mainly composed of carbon, wher eas S-type aster oids ar e primarily made up of silicate miner als.
ID: d7c5388f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The sentence emphasiz es a diff erence between C-type and S-type aster oids, noting that C-type
aster oids ar e mainly composed of carbon, while S-type aster oids ar e mainly composed of silicate miner als.
Choice A is incorr ect. The sentence states that C-type and S-type ar e two types of aster oids, but it doesn ’t emphasiz e a diff erence
between them. Choice B is incorr ect because it doesn ’t dir ectly mention C-type or S-type aster oids. Choice C is incorr ect. While the
sentence mentions that 17 per cent of known aster oids ar e S-type aster oids, it doesn ’t identify the per centage of aster oids that ar e
C-type. Ther efore, the sentence doesn ’t emphasiz e a diff erence between the two types.

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . “Meanwhile ” logically signals that the action described in this sentence (Obinz e’s mo ve to London t o
pursue a car eer) is simultaneous with the action described in the pr evious sentence (If emelu’ s mo ve to the United States). The
ﬁrst sentence establishes that the actions tak e place ar ound the same time, r eferring t o the char acters’ “ divergent experiences”
following high school.  
Choice B is incorr ect because “ nevertheless” illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Obinz e’s mo ve to
London is true despite the pr evious information about If emelu’ s mo ve to the United States. Instead, as the ﬁrst sentence
establishes, Obinz e’s mo ve and If emelu’ s mo ve are related, par allel experiences that occur ar ound the same time. Choice C is
incorr ect because “ secondly ” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a second point or r eason separ ate fr om the
previous information about If emelu’ s mo ve to the United States. Instead, as the ﬁrst sentence establishes, Obinz e’s mo ve and
Ifemelu’ s mo ve are related, par allel experiences that occur ar ound the same time. Choice D is incorr ect because “in fact” illogically
signals that the information in this sentence emphasiz es, modiﬁes, or contr adicts the pr evious information about If emelu’ s mo ve
to the United States. Instead, as the ﬁrst sentence establishes, Obinz e’s mo ve and If emelu’ s mo ve are related, par allel experiences

Choice B is the best answer . “Nonetheless” is a tr ansition that indicates disagr eement. The ﬁrst sentence describes the

Berlant did in fact ﬁnd much t o analyz e in Ashber y’s poem (“f ertile gr ound”), so the tr ansition “ nonetheless” ﬁts per fectly .

A. Dockless pr ograms can be disor ganiz ed; dock ed pr ograms, on the other hand, off er or der and consistency .
B. Worth noting is that while dockless pr ograms ar e relativ ely easy and inexpensiv e to implement, the y are less ﬂexible than

D. Though dockless pr ograms off er ﬂexibility , dock ed bik e-shar e programs pr ovide bicy cles for shar ed use.
ID: e98b1690  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The sentence compar es some disadv antages of dock ed and dockless bik e-shar e programs,
explaining that while dock ed pr ograms ar e mor e resour ce-intensiv e (requiring signiﬁcant space and mone y), dockless pr ograms
have greater or ganizational challenges.
Choice A is incorr ect. The sentence compar es dockless pr ograms t o dock ed pr ograms, noting an adv antage of dock ed pr ograms:
they off er or der and consistency . It doesn ’t compar e disadv antages of the two types of pr ograms. Choice B is incorr ect. The
sentence compar es dockless pr ograms t o dock ed pr ograms, noting an adv antage of dockless pr ograms: the y are easy and
inexpensiv e to implement. Howe ver, it misr epresents information fr om the notes, stating that dockless pr ograms ar e less ﬂexible
than dock ed pr ograms. In addition, it doesn ’t compar e disadv antages of the two types of pr ograms. Choice D is incorr ect. The
sentence emphasiz es an adv antage of dockless pr ograms, then mak es a gener al statement that applies t o both types of

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . “Then ” indicates that the e vents in this sentence t ook place after the e vents in the pr evious sentence.
Only after users upload images of unknown soldiers can those images be analyz ed.
Choice B is incorr ect. This tr ansition is used t o emphasiz e the truth of a statement that modiﬁes the pr evious statement. But this
sentence doesn ’t modify the step described in the pr evious statement: instead, it intr oduces an entir ely new step in the pr ocess.
So “in fact” wouldn ’t mak e sense her e. Choice C is incorr ect. This choice uses a tr ansition that indicates the addition of a new but
related idea, which doesn ’t mak e sense her e. Analyzing the physical f eatur es in the uploaded phot ographs isn ’t a similar idea, but
rather the next step in the pr ocess. Choice D is incorr ect. This choice uses an ex empliﬁcation tr ansition, which doesn ’t mak e sense

Choice A is the best answer . This choice uses a tr ansition that indicates a shift back in time. Since the ﬁrst sentence talks about
Thaden ’s race win in 1929 and the second shifts back t o talking about her r ecor d in 1928, this mak es the most sense her e.
Choice B is incorr ect. This choice uses a disagr eement tr ansition. But this sentence actually agr ees with and expands on the

Choice B is the best answer . This choice describes Adnan ’s December fr om My Window  in a wa y that assumes the audience is

Choice A is incorr ect. This choice isn ’t suited for an audience alr eady familiar with lepor ellos. A familiar audience wouldn ’t need t o

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . "For this r eason " is a cause-and-eff ect tr ansition. The cause in this case is that the mother elephant

doesn ’t use a quotation t o challenge Thucy dides’ s explanation: the quoted wor d "ine vitable " is fr om Thucy dides. Choice D is

The calendar used b y most of the world (the Gr egorian calendar) has 365 da ys.
Because 365 da ys can ’t be divided e venly b y 7 (the number of da ys in a week), calendar dates fall on a diff erent da y of the

The Hank e-Henr y permanent calendar , developed as an alternativ e to the Gr egorian calendar , has 364 da ys.
Because 364 can be divided e venly b y 7, calendar dates fall on the same da y of the week each y ear, which suppor ts mor e

Choice C is the best answer . The sentence explains an adv antage of the Hank e-Henr y calendar , noting that it suppor ts mor e
predictable scheduling than does the Gr egorian calendar and describing how it does so (b y having calendar dates occur on the
same da y each y ear).
Choice A is incorr ect. The sentence compar es the number of da ys in the Gr egorian and Hank e-Henr y calendars; it doesn ’t explain
an adv antage of the Hank e-Henr y calendar . Choice B is incorr ect. While the sentence r efers t o a possible r eason t o adopt the
Hank e-Henr y calendar—that doing so would help solv e a pr oblem with the Gr egorian calendar—it doesn ’t identify the pr oblem or

Choice A is incorr ect. While the sentence notes that Wisconsin ’s deﬁnition of a lak e doesn ’t tak e siz e int o account, it doesn ’t

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between a name and title and between a subject and

Additionally , no punctuation is needed between the sentence ’s subject (“Ent omologist Heather Gr ab”) and the main v erb (“found”)
that indicates what Gr ab did.
Choice A is incorr ect because no punctuation is needed between the subject and the v erb. Choice B is incorr ect because no
punctuation is needed. Setting the ent omologist’ s name off with commas suggests that it could be r emo ved without aff ecting the

Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice ensur es that the modifying

plastics, ” clearly establishing that the commer cial plastics—and not another noun in the sentence—ar e being described as cheap,

Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the function wor d “ther e” immediately after the

because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun “two pr oblems” immediately after the modifying phr ase
illogically suggests that the “ problems” ar e cheap, v ersatile, and easy t o produce. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in a

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es the noun phr ase “the
activists” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase “ after ...legislation. ” In doing so, this
choice clearly establishes that the activists—and not another noun in the sentence—wer e pleading for the passage of
antidiscrimination legislation.
Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase “ pressur e on lawmak ers”
immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that the “ pressur e” was pleading for the passage of antidiscrimination
legislation. Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase “ a sit-in pr otest”
immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that the “ protest” was pleading for the passage of antidiscrimination
legislation. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase “lawmak ers”
immediately after the modifying phr ase suggests that “lawmak ers” wer e pleading for the passage of antidiscrimination legislation.
While it’ s possible for lawmak ers t o plead for the passage of legislation, the context str ongly suggests that it’ s the activists who

Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erbs t o expr ess tense in a sentence. In this choice, the
past pr ogressiv e tense v erb “ was studying” is consistent with the other past tense v erbs (e.g., “ made ” and “ collected”) used t o

B. speculativ e, though ; 
C. speculativ e; though 
D. speculativ e, though , 
ID: f78997cf  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation in a sentence. This choice corr ectly uses a
comma t o separ ate the supplementar y adv erb "though " from the pr eceding main clause ("Such interpr etations ar e ultimately
speculativ e") and uses a semicolon t o join the next main clause ("the object’ s...mak eup") to the r est of the sentence. F urther,
placing the semicolon after "though " indicates that the information in the pr eceding main clause (interpr etations of an outer solar
system object’ s composition based on its color ar e ultimately speculativ e) is a qualiﬁcation of the information in the pr evious
sentence (the composition of an outer solar system object is suggested b y its color).
Choice A is incorr ect because it fails t o mark the boundar y between the two main clauses with appr opriate punctuation. Choice C
is incorr ect because placing the semicolon after " speculativ e" illogically indicates that the information in the next main clause
("the object’ s...mak eup") is a qualiﬁcation of the information in the pr evious clause ("Such...speculativ e"). Choice D is incorr ect
because it r esults in a comma splice. Commas can ’t be used in this wa y to punctuate a supplementar y wor d or phr ase between
two main clauses.

D. a less concentr ated mark et will ha ve an HHI scor e that is much lower .
ID: fced396a  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es the noun phr ase "the
HHI...mark et" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase " compar ed...mark et." In doing so,
this choice clearly establishes that the HHI scor e of a less concentr ated mark et—and not another noun in the sentence—is being
compar ed with the HHI scor e of a highly concentr ated mark et.
Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of " a mark et that is less concentr ated" immediately
after the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that a mark et is being compar ed with an HHI scor e. Choice C is incorr ect because it
results in a confusing, illogical sentence. The placement of the modiﬁer " when a mark et is less concentr ated" after " a highly
concentr ated mark et" is contr adict ory. Furthermor e, it’s ambiguous what "its" is r eferring t o in "its HHI scor e," resulting in an
illogical comparison. Choice D is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of " a less concentr ated

Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erbs t o expr ess tense. In this choice, the past per fect v erb

Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erbs t o expr ess tense in a sentence. In this choice, the
present tense v erb “r each ” is consistent with the pr esent tense v erbs “tr avel” and “ are div erted” used t o describe how at oms mo ve
through the synchr otron.
Choice A is incorr ect because the futur e tense v erb “ will r each ” is inconsistent with the pr esent tense v erbs used t o describe how
atoms mo ve thr ough the synchr otron. Though the at oms’ mo vement is a r ecurring action and “ will r each ” can also be used t o
indicate a habitual or r ecurring action, it cr eates a logical inconsistency in this sentence when pair ed with the pr esent tense v erbs
“travel” and “ are div erted.” Choice C is incorr ect because the past per fect tense v erb “had r eached” is inconsistent with the pr esent
tense v erbs used t o describe how at oms mo ve thr ough the synchr otron. Choice D is incorr ect because the pr esent pr ogressiv e
tense v erb “ are reaching” is inconsistent with the pr esent tense v erbs used t o describe how at oms mo ve thr ough the synchr otron.
While both v erbs occur in the pr esent, the pr esent pr ogressiv e tense suggests that the action is curr ently in pr ogress. This cr eates
a logical inconsistency when pair ed with the pr esent tense v erbs “tr avel” and “ are div erted,” which off er a gener al description of

ID: 9091458d  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice corr ectly uses a question
mark t o punctuate the interr ogativ e sentence “how ar e the y able t o mo ve so fast?” The interr ogativ e sentence asks a dir ect
question, and the next sentence answers it.
Choice A is incorr ect because the context r equir es an interr ogativ e sentence. The ex clamativ e sentence “how the y are able t o
move so fast!” emphasiz es the penguin ’s high r ate of speed, but it doesn ’t set up the next sentence ’s explanation of how the
penguins achie ve such speeds. Choice B is incorr ect because a period can ’t be used in this wa y to punctuate an interr ogativ e
sentence. Choice C is incorr ect because the context r equir es an interr ogativ e sentence. The ex clamativ e sentence “how the y are

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between two supplementar y phr ases following the

(“producing...London ”) that pr ovides additional information about the extent t o which P otter dedicated herself t o my cology .
Choice A is incorr ect because a semicolon can ’t be used in this wa y to join two supplementar y phr ases following a coor dinate

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the punctuation of elements in a complex series. It’ s conv entional t o
use a semicolon t o separ ate items in a complex series with internal punctuation, and in this choice, the semicolon after "lea ves" is
conv entionally used t o separ ate the ﬁrst item (" natur al debris, such as dried lea ves") and the second item (" man-made tr ash, such

"man-made tr ash" from the supplementar y phr ase (" such as plastic bags") that describes it.
Choice A is incorr ect because a comma after "lea ves" doesn ’t match the semicolon used later t o separ ate the second and thir d

Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period after
“Bay” is used corr ectly t o mark the boundar y between one sentence (“On…Ba y”) and another sentence that begins with a
supplementar y phr ase (“Ha ving…y ears”). Her e, the supplementar y phr ase beginning with “ha ving” modiﬁes the subject of the
second sentence, “the celebr ated ship. ”
Choice A is incorr ect. Without a comma pr eceding it, the conjunction “ and” can ’t be used in this wa y to join sentences. Choice C is
incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. A comma can ’t be used in this wa y to join two sentences. Choice D is incorr ect
because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The sentences (“On…Ba y” and “ha ving…y ears”) ar e fused without punctuation and/or a

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation ar ound noun phr ases. No punctuation is
needed because the noun phr ase “ aluminum o xide” is a r estrictiv e appositiv e, meaning that it pr ovides essential identifying
information about the noun phr ase befor e it, “the chemical compound, ” and thus doesn ’t requir e punctuation ar ound it.
Choice A is incorr ect because no punctuation is needed. Choice B is incorr ect because no punctuation is needed. Choice C is
incorr ect because the noun phr ase “ aluminum o xide” is a r estrictiv e appositiv e. Setting the phr ase off with punctuation suggests
that it could be r emo ved without aff ecting the coher ence of the sentence, which isn ’t the case.

ID: 6e071432  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
B
Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the punctuation of supplementar y elements within a sentence. The
comma after " described" separ ates the ﬁrst supplementar y element ("both of inter viewees and the items the y described") fr om the
second supplementar y element ("fr om hair t o grass t o sculptur es"). F urthermor e, the dash after " sculptur es" pairs with the dash
after " phot ographs" t o separ ate these two supplementar y elements fr om the r est of the sentence. The pair of dashes, which
oper ate at a higher or ganizing le vel than the comma, indicates that the elements between the dashes function t ogether—in this
case, the second supplement ("fr om…sculptur es") describes the r ange of items mentioned in the ﬁrst supplement—and could be
remo ved without aff ecting the gr ammatical coher ence of the sentence.
Choice A is incorr ect because it fails t o appr opriately punctuate the supplementar y elements in the sentence. A dash is needed
after " sculptur es" t o separ ate the supplementar y elements ("both…sculptur es") fr om the r est of the sentence. Choice C is incorr ect
because it fails t o appr opriately punctuate the supplementar y elements in the sentence. The two supplementar y elements "both…
described" and "fr om…sculptur es" function t ogether t o describe the phot ographs, and placing a dash between them would mak e
this r elationship less clear , suggesting that the supplement "both...described" is a standalone element that could be r emo ved
without aff ecting the gr ammatical coher ence of the sentence, which isn ’t the case. Choice D is incorr ect because it fails t o
appr opriately punctuate the supplementar y elements in the sentence. A colon isn ’t conv entionally used in this wa y to separ ate a
supplementar y element ("fr om hair t o grass t o sculptur es") fr om the noun phr ase it is modifying ("items the y described").
Additionally , a dash is needed after " sculptur es" t o separ ate the supplementar y elements ("both…sculptur es") fr om the r est of the

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementar y element within a sentence. The
comma after " sisters" pairs with the comma after " Butterﬂies " to separ ate the supplementar y element " a ﬁctionaliz ed account of
the liv es of the Mir abal sisters" fr om the r est of the sentence. This supplementar y element functions t o describe the no vel In the
Time of the Butterﬂies , and the pair of commas indicates that this element could be r emo ved without aff ecting the gr ammatical
coher ence of the sentence.
Choice A is incorr ect because a comma and conjunction can ’t be used in this wa y to separ ate the supplementar y element fr om the
rest of the sentence. Choice B is incorr ect because it fails t o use appr opriate punctuation t o separ ate the supplementar y element

ID: d2b81427  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es the noun phr ase
“many critics” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase “in assessing…K urosawa. ” In doing
so, this choice clearly establishes that it is the critics—and not another noun in the sentence—who assess K urosawa ’s ﬁlms.
Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase “K urosawa ’s…sour ces”
immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that his use of W estern liter ary sour ces is what assesses K urosawa ’s
ﬁlms. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the function wor d “ther e” immediately after
the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that “ther e” is what assesses K urosawa ’s ﬁlms. Choice D is incorr ect because it r esults in
a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase “the focus…critics” immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically

Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of a colon within a sentence. In this choice, the colon is used
in a conv entional wa y to intr oduce the following description of how the number of jams a vailable v aried. 
Choice B is incorr ect because it cr eates a comma splice. A comma can ’t be used in this wa y to join two main clauses (“the

Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es the pr oper noun
"Matthew Henson " the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase " one…centur y." In doing so,
this choice clearly establishes that Matthew Henson—and not another noun in the sentence—is being described as one of the f ew

Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase "1891 and 1909" immediately
after the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that those y ears wer e one of the f ew African American global explor ers during the
turn of the 20th centur y. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the pr oper noun
"Greenland" immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that Gr eenland was one of the f ew African American

ID: 1f8cd95f  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erbs t o expr ess tense. In this choice, the simple past tense
verb “ suggested” pr operly indicates that Z ufall off ered her suggestion for the pr oduct’ s name in the past. This v erb tense is

Choice B is incorr ect because the pr esent tense v erb “ suggests” doesn ’t indicate that Z ufall off ered her suggestion in the

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used
correctly t o mark the boundar y between the ﬁrst sentence (“On…temper ature”) and the second sentence (“ Adding…eff ect”). The
gerund phr ase beginning with “ adding” is the subject of the second sentence, and the v erb phr ase “helps combat this eff ect”
describes what adding a light-color ed co vering can do. 
Choice A is incorr ect because a semicolon can ’t be used in this wa y to join the sentence “On...temper ature” and the supplementar y
phrases that follow . Doing so lea ves the v erb phr ase “helps combat” without a subject and thus r esults in a gr ammatically
unconv entional sentence. Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. A comma can ’t be used in this wa y to mark
the boundar y between sentences. Choice D is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests
that adding a light-color ed co vering t o an existing dark r oof r aises the temper ature of the surr ounding air . Furthermor e, it cr eates

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementar y wor d or phr ase between two main

(“Okinaka doesn ’t…single-handedly ”) and a semicolon t o join the next main clause (“ all…cultur e”) to the r est of the sentence.
Further, placing the semicolon after “howe ver” corr ectly indicates that the information in the pr eceding main clause (Okinaka
doesn ’t mak e such decisions single-handedly) is contr ary to what might be assumed fr om the information in the pr evious
sentence (Okinaka sits on the r eview boar d that adds new sites t o the Hawaii Register of Hist oric Places).
Choice B is incorr ect because placing the semicolon after “ single-handedly ” and the comma after “howe ver” illogically indicates
that the information in the next main clause (all hist orical designations must be appr oved b y a gr oup of exper ts) is contr ary to the
information in the pr evious clause (Okinaka doesn ’t mak e such decisions single-handedly). Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults
in a comma splice. Commas can ’t be used in this wa y to punctuate a supplementar y wor d or phr ase between two main

Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of a colon within a sentence. In this choice, the colon is
correctly used t o intr oduce the following explanation of what the P atriot cause had gr own int o by 1774.
Choice B is incorr ect because a semicolon can ’t be used in this wa y to join the main clause (" what…extensiv e") and the

independent clauses. This choice uses a comma plus a coor dinating conjunction t o link them t ogether , which is one of the corr ect
ways to link two independent clauses. 
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a run-on sentence err or. Both clauses in this sentence could stand alone as complete

comma befor ehand. Choice D is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a run-on sentence err or. Both clauses in this sentence could
stand alone as complete sentences, which means the y are both independent clauses. Independent clauses need t o ha ve cer tain

ID: 4f2ff5f2  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erbs t o expr ess tense in a sentence. In this choice, the
present tense v erb " goes" is consistent with the other pr esent tense v erbs (" appears" and " symboliz es") used t o describe the
tortoise in St oppar d’s pla y. Furthermor e, it’s conv entional t o use the pr esent tense when discussing a liter ary work.
Choice B is incorr ect because the futur e per fect tense v erb " will ha ve gone " isn’t consistent with the other pr esent tense v erbs
used t o describe the t ortoise in St oppar d’s pla y. Choice C is incorr ect because the past tense v erb " went" isn ’t consistent with the
other pr esent tense v erbs used t o describe the t ortoise in St oppar d’s pla y. Choice D is incorr ect because the past per fect tense

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the punctuation of a r estrictiv e coor dinated noun phr ase. No
punctuation is needed within or ar ound the coor dinated noun phr ase “r esear chers Rober to Scandone and Christ opher Kilburn ”
because it would cr eate an illogical separ ation between the noun “r esear chers” and the coor dinated noun phr ase “Rober to
Scandone and Christ opher Kilburn. ”
Choice A is incorr ect because no punctuation is needed. Placing a pair of commas ar ound the coor dinated noun phr ase “Rober to
Scandone and Christ opher Kilburn ” creates an illogical separ ation between the noun “r esear chers” and the afor ementioned
coor dinated noun phr ase. In this case, it illogically suggests that r esear chers in gener al bear the speciﬁc names Rober to

Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es the noun phr ase
"topological tapestries" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase " woven…gr andmother ." In
doing so, this choice clearly establishes that the t opological tapestries—and not another noun in the sentence—ar e being

Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase " Argentine textile ar tist Alexandr a

Choice B is the best answer . The phr ase “ accor ding t o Swentz ell” is an aside that interrupts the ﬂow of the sentence, so it needs t o
be separ ated fr om the sentence with a pair of matching punctuation marks: two commas, two dashes, or a pair of par entheses.
We alr eady ha ve a comma befor e “accor ding, ” so we must add a comma after “Swentz ell.” .
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice cr eates a punctuation err or. The phr ase “ accor ding t o Swentz ell” is an aside that interrupts the

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . “Nine months…off ense ” and “ accor ding t o…system ” are both independent clauses. Separ ating them
with a period and turning them int o their own sentences is the only gr ammatically corr ect choice among the pr ovided options.
Choice B is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a comma splice err or, which is a punctuation err or that occurs when two independent

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used

the adv erbial phr ase beginning with “ prior ” indicates when changing a spr eadsheet r equir ed redoing the sheet b y hand, that phr ase

Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. Two sentences ar e fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.
Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. A comma can ’t be used in this wa y to mark the boundar y between

ID: 548f4956  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the coor dination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice uses
a semicolon in a conv entional wa y to join the ﬁrst main clause (“It is…ones”) and the second main clause  (“ even so…needs”).
Furthermor e, the placement of the semicolon after “ ones” indicates that the supplementar y phr ase “ even so ” modiﬁes the
following clause (“the r eawak ening...needs”), r esulting in the most logical and gr ammatically complete sentence. With this
punctuation, the sentence logically indicates that the r ecent inter est in an old technology lik e steam engines is despite the fact
that technological change typically seeks out new technologies.
Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a confusing and illogical sentence. Placing the semicolon after “ so” indicates that the
supplementar y element “ even so ” modiﬁes the ﬁrst clause of the sentence, which doesn ’t mak e sense in this context. Choice B is
incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. It fails t o mark the boundar y between the two main clauses with appr opriate
punctuation. Choice D is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can ’t be used
in this wa y to join the two main clauses of the sentence.

Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation in a sentence. In this choice, a colon is
correctly used t o mark the boundar y between one main clause (" Along with...phot osynthesis") and another main clause (" as

Choice A is incorr ect because when coor dinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’ s conv entional t o use a comma befor e
the coor dinating conjunction (" and"). Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. Without a coor dinating
conjunction following it, a comma can ’t be used in this wa y to join two main clauses (" Along with...phot osynthesis" and " as

ID: dd6a0326  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es the noun phr ase
“Julian ’s 1935 synthesis” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase “ named…y ears. ” In
doing so, this choice clearly establishes that Julian ’s 1935 synthesis of the alkaloid physostigmine—and not another noun in the
sentence—was named in 1999 as one of the gr eatest achie vements b y a US chemist in the past hundr ed years.  
Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun “Julian ” immediately after the modifying
phrase illogically suggests that Julian himself was named as one of the gr eatest achie vements b y a US chemist in the past
hundr ed years. Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the pr epositional phr ase “in 1935”
immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically and confusingly suggests that “in 1935” was named as one of the gr eatest
achie vements b y a US chemist in the past hundr ed years. Choice D is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The
placement of the noun phr ase “the alkaloid physostigmine ” immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically and confusingly

Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between a main clause and a supplementar y phr ase.
In this choice, a colon is corr ectly used t o mark the boundar y between the main clause (“ A study …continents”) and the
supplementar y phr ase (“ geological…abo ve”) and t o intr oduce the following explanation of the origin of Ear th’s continents.
Choice A is incorr ect because it fails t o mark the boundar y between the main clause (“ A study …continents”) and the

Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used
correctly t o mark the boundar y between one sentence (“Howe ver...earlier ”) and another (“In...ar ea”). The supplementar y phr ase “in
1420 CE” modiﬁes “humans, ” the subject of the thir d sentence.
Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. A comma can ’t be used in this wa y to mark the boundar y between
sentences. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. A comma can ’t be used in this wa y to mark the boundar y
between sentences. Mor eover, the subor dinating conjunction “ which ” creates a confusing and illogical sentence that suggests
that the supplementar y phr ase beginning with “in ” modiﬁes the pr evious information (“Howe ver...earlier ”) rather than the
information that follows. Choice D is incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The sentences (“Howe ver...earlier ” and

Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation between titles and pr oper nouns. No
punctuation is needed t o set off the pr oper noun "Diane Massam " from the title that describes Massam, "linguist. " Because "Diane
Massam " is essential information identifying the "linguist, " no punctuation is necessar y.

Choice A is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a punctuation err or. The r elativ e clause " which is known as Br ownian motion " is a

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the coor dination of main clauses. This choice corr ectly uses a comma
and the coor dinating conjunction “but” t o join the ﬁrst main clause (“Materials…Ru”) and the second main clause (“the allo y…
NiCoCr ”).
Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses ar e fused without punctuation and/or a
conjunction. Choice B is incorr ect because when coor dinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’ s conv entional t o use a
comma befor e the coor dinating conjunction. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. Without a conjunction
following it, a comma can ’t be used in this wa y to join two main clauses.

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice corr ectly uses a
comma t o separ ate the supplementar y adv erb "though " from the pr eceding main clause ("The y are har dly pristine ") and uses a
semicolon t o join the two main clauses ("The y…though " and " many …objects"). F urther, placing the semicolon after "though "
indicates that the information in the pr eceding main clause (chondrites ar e far fr om pristine) is contr ary to what might be
assumed fr om the information in the pr evious sentence (chondrites ha ve been gener ally unalter ed b y their envir onment).
Choice A is incorr ect because placing the comma after " pristine " and using "though " as a subor dinating conjunction illogically
indicates that the information in the next main clause (many chondrites ha ve experienced damage) is contr ary to the information
in the pr evious clause (chondrites ar e far fr om pristine). Choice C is incorr ect because placing the semicolon after " pristine "
illogically indicates that the information in the next main clause (many chondrites ha ve experienced damage) is contr ary to the

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . Subject-modiﬁer placement r equir es a modiﬁer and its subject t o be next t o each other . The subject
of the modiﬁer " a coming-of-age st ory…colonialism " is Chr aïbi’s no vel The Simple P ast, so the subject "Chr aïbi’s debut no vel" ﬁts
perfectly after this intr oduct ory modifying phr ase.
Choice A is incorr ect. Modiﬁers and their subjects must go next t o each other . The intr oduct ory modiﬁer " a coming-of-age st ory…

Choice D is incorr ect. Modiﬁers and their subjects must go next t o each other . The modiﬁer " a coming-of-age st ory…" is describing

Choice B is incorr ect because it fails t o mark the boundar y between the two main clauses with appr opriate punctuation. With

D. silica glass’ s atomic arr angement is mor e dispersed, r esulting in a signiﬁcant disadv antage:
ID: 2dd1b8bf  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es “silica glass’ s atomic
arrangement” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase “ compar ed to that of alumina
glass. ” In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that silica glass’ s atomic arr angement—and not another noun in the sentence—
is being compar ed to the at omic arr angement (“that”) of alumina glass.
Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase “ silica glass” immediately after
the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that silica glass itself (r ather than its at omic arr angement) is being compar ed to alumina
glass’ s atomic arr angement. Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase
“silica glass” immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically suggests that silica glass itself (r ather than its at omic
arrangement) is being compar ed to alumina glass’ s atomic arr angement. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling
modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase “ a signiﬁcant disadv antage ” immediately after the modifying phr ase illogically
suggests that “ a signiﬁcant disadv antage ” is being compar ed to alumina glass’ s atomic arr angement.

Choice A is the best answer . This choice uses a comma and a coor dinating conjunction (“ and”) t o join two independent clauses

Choice B is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a gr ammar err or known as a run-on sentence. The clauses befor e and after “T ribe” are

D. indiscriminate: 
ID: 8772475b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between two main clauses. In this choice, a colon is

("the y will de vour all kinds of shrubs and weeds") and t o intr oduce the following explanation of goats’ nondiscriminat ory beha vior
when it comes t o what the y eat.
Choice A is incorr ect because when coor dinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’ s conv entional t o use a comma befor e
the coor dinating conjunction. F urthermor e, the conjunction " and" fails t o indicate that what follows is an explanation of goats’
nondiscriminat ory beha vior when it comes t o their diets. Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. A comma
can’t be used in this wa y to join two main clauses (" goats…indiscriminate " and "the y…weeds"). Choice C is incorr ect because it

In 1943, in the midst of W orld W ar II, mathematics pr ofessor Gr ace Hopper was r ecruited b y the US militar y to help the war effor t
by solving complex equations. Hopper ’s subsequent car eer would inv olve mor e than just ______  as a pioneering computer
programmer , Hopper would help usher in the digital age.
Which choice completes the text so that it conforms t o the conv entions of Standar d English?
A. equations, though:
B. equations, though,
C. equations. Though,
D. equations though
ID: 84658166  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation t o mark boundaries between supplements and
clauses. The comma after “ equations” is used t o separ ate the independent clause (“Hopper ’s…equation ”) from the supplementar y
adverb phr ase “though. ” The colon after “though ” is used t o mark the boundar y between the clause ending with “though ” and the
following clause (“ as…age ”). A colon used in this wa y intr oduces information that illustr ates or explains information that has come
befor e it. In this case, the colon after “though ” intr oduces the following explanation of how Hopper ’s subsequent car eer would
involve mor e than just solving equations: she would become a pioneering computer pr ogrammer .
Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. A comma can ’t be used in this wa y to join two independent clauses
(“Hopper ’s…though ” and “ as…age ”) such as these. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in an illogical sequence of sentences.
Placing the period after “ equations” and beginning the next sentence with “Though ” illogically suggests that the following
information (that Hopper would help usher in the digital age) is contr ary to the information in the pr evious sentence (Hopper ’s
subsequent car eer would inv olve mor e than just solving equations). Instead, the information that follows suppor ts the information
from the pr evious sentence b y explaining how her work and inﬂuence extended be yond solely solving equations. Choice D is
incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The two independent clauses (“Hopper ’s…though ” and “ as…age ”) are fused
without punctuation.

A. to ha ve suspended
B. suspending
C. to suspend
D. suspended
ID: 7c48a6dd  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
D
Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The past tense of " suspended" matches the past tense of " applied, " which has the same subject ("he ")
and tak es place in the same context: "He applied…and [he] suspended. "
Choice A is incorr ect. The per fect inﬁnitiv e "to ha ve suspended" doesn ’t match the past tense of " applied, " and it can ’t ser ve as a
verb on its own. These ar e both v erbs with the same subject and in the same context, so ther e’s no need t o shift tenses. Choice B
is incorr ect. The pr esent par ticiple " suspending" doesn ’t match the past tense of " applied, " and it can ’t ser ve as a v erb on its own.
These ar e both v erbs with the same subject and in the same context, so ther e’s no need t o shift tenses. Choice C is incorr ect. The

C. work ; though ,
D. work , though ;
ID: e3c1b4f7  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. The comma after " work"
pairs with the comma after "though " to separ ate the supplementar y element "though " from the r est of the sentence. This
supplementar y element signals that what follows is an ex ception t o Chen using softwar e tools t o create illustr ations, and the pair
of commas indicates that this element could be r emo ved without aff ecting the gr ammatical coher ence of the sentence.
Choice B is incorr ect because the comma after " work" must be pair ed with a comma after "though " to separ ate the supplementar y
element fr om the r est of the sentence. Choice C is incorr ect because a semicolon can ’t be pair ed with a comma in this wa y to
separ ate the supplementar y element fr om the r est of the sentence. Choice D is incorr ect because a semicolon can ’t be pair ed with
a comma in this wa y to separ ate the supplementar y element fr om the r est of the sentence.

ID: 5cc85f01  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation between a supplementar y phr ase and a main clause. This
choice corr ectly uses a comma t o mark the boundar y between the supplementar y phr ase (“ A conceptual ar tist…world”), which
describes Mar y Ping, and the main clause (“Mar y…America ”).
Choice A is incorr ect because it fails t o mark the boundar y between the supplementar y phr ase (“ A conceptual ar tist…world”) and
the main clause (“Mar y…America ”) with appr opriate punctuation. Choice B is incorr ect because a colon can ’t be used in this wa y to
join the supplementar y phr ase (“ A conceptual ar tist…world”) and the main clause (“Mar y…America ”). In this context, the colon
incorr ectly suggests that the information in the supplementar y phr ase is an explanation or ampliﬁcation of the information in the
main clause (Mar y Ping being chosen t o cur ate the exhibition), which isn ’t the case. Choice C is incorr ect because a semicolon
can’t be used in this wa y to join the supplementar y phr ase (“ A conceptual ar tist…world”) and the main clause (“Mar y…America ”).
Semicolons ar e conv entionally used t o separ ate two main clauses or t o separ ate items in a complex series.

Choice A is the best answer . Nothing belongs t o the “ poems” in the sentence, so it should not be possessiv e—just a simple plur al
noun. The pr otagonist does belong t o the no vel—it’ s the pr otagonist of the no vel—so “ novel” needs t o be a singular possessiv e

Choice B is incorr ect. This doesn ’t complete the text in a wa y that conforms t o the conv entions of Standar d English. This choice
uses the singular possessiv e “poem ’s,” but the text indicates that it should be the simple plur al “poems”: ther e is mor e than one

correctly uses the r elativ e pronoun “that” and no punctuation t o create an integr ated r elativ e clause that pr ovides essential

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . It appr opriately uses a period t o mark the end of one independent clause ("In 2000…settings") and the

Choice A is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a run-on sentence err or. Both the clause befor e the blank ("In 2000…settings") and the

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erbs t o expr ess tense in a sentence. In this choice, the
past tense v erb “ was ruled” corr ectly indicates that Oba E wuar e I ruled the Kingdom of Benin in the distant past (fr om 1440 t o

Choice A is incorr ect because the pr esent tense v erb “is ruled” doesn ’t indicate that Oba E wuar e I ruled the Kingdom of Benin in
the distant past. Choice B is incorr ect because the futur e tense v erb “ will be ruled” doesn ’t indicate that Oba E wuar e I ruled the
Kingdom of Benin in the distant past. Choice C is incorr ect because the pr esent per fect tense v erb “has been ruled” doesn ’t

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. This choice corr ectly uses a

participial phr ase " developed b y Japanese violinist Shinichi Suzuki" modiﬁes the subject of the next sentence, "the method. "
Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The sentences ("The pedagogy ...tenets" and "De veloped... ‘Mar ch in
G’") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice C is incorr ect because it cr eates a confusing and illogical
sentence structur e. The r elativ e pronoun "that" followed b y a comma can ’t be used in this wa y to mark the boundar y between

Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used

Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The two sentences (" A ray…works" and "Because…image ") are fused

ID: 7e37aff c Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. This choice uses a
semicolon in a conv entional wa y to join the ﬁrst main clause ("That the...inv olved") and the second main clause
("establishing...divisiv e"). Further, the semicolon is the most appr opriate choice when joining two separ ate, par allel statements,
such as her e, wher e the information following the semicolon contr asts with the information befor e.
Choice A is incorr ect because placing a colon after "inv olved" illogically indicates that the information in the second main clause
(the pr ecise location was the subject of disagr eement) explains or ampliﬁes the information in the pr evious main clause (the
gener al location was agr eed upon b y all). Instead, the information in the second clause contr asts with the pr evious information.
Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a comma can ’t be used in this wa y
to join two main clauses. Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses ar e fused without
punctuation and/or a conjunction.

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is end-of-sentence punctuation. This choice corr ectly uses a question
mark t o punctuate the interr ogativ e clause “ could the blueberries thriv e,” which asks a dir ect question at the end of the sentence.
Choice A is incorr ect because a period can ’t be used in this wa y to punctuate an interr ogativ e clause, such as “ could the
blueberries thriv e,” at the end of a sentence. Choice B is incorr ect because the context r equir es an interr ogativ e clause. The
declar ative clause “the blueberries could thriv e” incorr ectly indicates that it was known that the blueberries could thriv e in alkaline
soil, wher eas Michel had y et to ﬁnd this out. Choice C is incorr ect because a question mark can ’t be used in this wa y to punctuate

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erb forms within a sentence. The nonﬁnite past par ticiple
"char acteriz ed" is corr ectly used within a supplementar y element that modiﬁes the main clause "Zhang... shanshui ," deﬁning qinglü
shanshui  and explaining some of its identifying tr aits.
Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. Using the ﬁnite pr esent per fect tense v erb "has been char acteriz ed"
creates a second main clause in the sentence, and the two main clauses can ’t be joined in this wa y by only the comma befor e "a

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . Misaka ser ved in W orld W ar II befor e he joined the New Y ork K nicks in 1947. To show that a past
occurr ence t ook place befor e another past occurr ence, we need t o use “had” + the past tense form of the v erb. This is called the
past per fect tense.
Choice A is incorr ect. Misaka ser ved in W orld W ar II befor e he joined the K nicks. Both e vents ar e in the past, but his ser vice in
World W ar II happened earlier , so we need a v erb that mak es it clear that his ser vice (and the two national championships) had
ended b y the time he joined the K nicks. Choice B is incorr ect. “W as alr eady ser ving” forms the continuous past tense, which we
use when we ’re showing a past action that was ongoing. Misaka ser ved in W orld W ar II befor e he joined the K nicks. Both e vents
are in the past, but the y’re not happening at the same time, so we shouldn ’t use the continuous past tense her e. Choice C is
incorr ect. Misaka ser ved in W orld W ar II in the past, so we shouldn ’t use the pr esent tense “ serves.”

Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es the noun phr ase
"Iceland’ s parliament" the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase " a go vernment body
oﬃcially known as the Althing. " In doing so, this choice clearly establishes that Iceland’ s parliament—and not another noun in the

Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase "the world’ s oldest parliaments"

Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is punctuation use between sentences. In this choice, the period is used

Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erbs t o expr ess tense. In this choice, the pr esent tense
verb “ﬂy ” is consistent with the other pr esent tense v erb ( “journe y”) used t o describe the butterﬂies’ y early migr ation. Together ,

ID: c101f c44 Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
A
Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . “A team…tried something new” is an independent clause leading t o an explanation of what the new
thing was. A colon can only be used at the end of an independent clause, and typically intr oduces fur ther explanation that expands
upon the ﬁrst clause, which mak es a colon the per fect choice her e.
Choice B is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a punctuation err or. “Sequencing…dental plaque ” can ’t stand on its own as a sentence,
and so it can ’t be link ed to the independent clause “ a team…tried something new” with a semicolon. Only two independent clauses
can be connected in this wa y. Choice C is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a punctuation err or. If “sequencing” is included in the
ﬁrst clause, it can no longer stand on its own as a complete idea. Since a colon can only come at the end of an independent
clause, using one in this wa y creates an err or. Choice D is incorr ect. This choice r esults in a sentence fr agment. “Sequencing…
dental plaque ” can ’t stand on its own as a sentence.

("The y...antiquity ") and uses a semicolon t o join the ﬁrst independent clause ("The y...antiquity ") and the second independent

Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erb forms within a sentence. The nonﬁnite pr esent

Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. The pr onoun "this" and the ﬁnite futur e tense v erb " will ensur e" would

Choice C is incorr ect because it r esults in an ungr ammatical sentence. The ﬁnite pr esent tense v erb " ensur es" can ’t be used in this

ID: 7ce4ee13  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:
C
Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the coor dination of main clauses within a sentence. This choice
correctly uses a comma and the coor dinating conjunction " and" t o join the ﬁrst main clause ("In 1919 Larr azolo was elected
governor of New Mexico ") and the second main clause ("in 1928 he became the nation ’s ﬁrst Hispanic US Senat or").
Choice A is incorr ect because when coor dinating two longer main clauses such as these, it’ s conv entional t o use a comma befor e
the coor dinating conjunction. Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. Without a conjunction following it, a
comma can ’t be used in this wa y to join two main clauses. Choice D is incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The two
main clauses ar e fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.

ID: aa443c4b  Answer
Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of v erb forms within a sentence. The nonﬁnite pr esent
participle " suggesting" is corr ectly used t o form a r estrictiv e par ticipial phr ase (" suggesting...Holocene ") within the main clause
("This hypothesis...cannot stand... "). This par ticipial phr ase functions as par t of the sentence ’s subject ("This...Holocene "),
providing essential identifying information about what the hypothesis states—namely , that cer tain tr ees sur vived without
interruption or human inter vention thr oughout the Holocene.
Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in an ungr ammatical sentence. The ﬁnite v erb " suggested" can ’t be used in this wa y within

Corr ect A nswer:

Rationale
Choice C is the best answer . The conv entions being tested ar e punctuation use between titles and pr oper nouns and between
verbs and integr ated quotations. No punctuation is needed t o set off the pr oper noun “Stina Chyn ” from the title that describes
Chyn, “ critic. ” Because “Stina Chyn ” is essential information identifying the “ critic, ” no punctuation is necessar y. Further, no
punctuation is needed between the v erb “ claims” and the following quotation because the quotation is integr ated int o the
structur e of the sentence.
Choice A is incorr ect because no punctuation is needed befor e or after the pr oper noun “Stina Chyn. ” Setting the critic ’s name off
with commas suggests that it could be r emo ved without aff ecting the coher ence of the sentence, which isn ’t the case. Choice B is
incorr ect because no punctuation is needed befor e or after the pr oper noun “Stina Chyn. ” Setting the critic ’s name off with

Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation between titles and pr oper nouns. No
punctuation is needed t o set off the pr oper noun "W akako Y amauchi" fr om the title that describes Y amauchi, " pioneering

playwright’ s name off with commas suggests that it could be r emo ved without aff ecting the coher ence of the sentence, which isn ’t
the case. Choice B is incorr ect because no punctuation is needed between the title " pioneering pla ywright" and the pr oper noun

Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is pr onoun–antecedent agr eement. The singular pr onoun “it” agr ees in

Rationale
Choice B is the best answer . The text uses a dash t o intr oduce a nonessential element that explains the acr onym FEST AC. The
dash matches the dash that comes after “known, ” ending the descriptiv e aside.
Choice A is incorr ect. A colon can only come after an independent clause, which isn ’t the case her e. Choice C is incorr ect. While
punctuation is r equir ed to set off “ or FEST AC…known ” from the r est of the sentence, nonessential elements must be separ ated
from the sentence with matching punctuation. Since a dash appears on the other side of the element, we can ’t use a comma her e.
Choice D is incorr ect. The descriptiv e aside “ or FEST AC…known ” is a nonessential element that must be separ ated with
punctuation fr om the r est of the sentence. This choice fails t o add the necessar y punctuation befor e the nonessential element.

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of a colon within a sentence. In this choice, the colon corr ectly
introduces the following explanation of the diff erent functions of genomes and epigenomes.
Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses ("The r elationship…functions" and " wher eas…
expr essed") ar e fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction. Choice B is incorr ect because it r esults in a comma splice. A
comma can ’t be used in this wa y to join two main clauses ("The r elationship…functions" and " wher eas…expr essed"). Choice C is
incorr ect. Without a comma pr eceding it, the conjunction " and" can ’t be used in this wa y to join two main clauses. F urthermor e,
"and" fails t o indicate that what follows is an explanation of how cells with identical DN A de velop diff erent functions.

Choice A is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the use of punctuation within a sentence. In this choice, the colon
correctly intr oduces the series of goals held b y the 1919 Inter-Allied W omen ’s Conf erence.
Choice B is incorr ect because placing a period after "thr eefold" r esults in a rhet orically unacceptable sentence fr agment beginning

Choice B is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is subject-modiﬁer placement. This choice mak es the noun phr ase
“Anna Behr ensme yer” the subject of the sentence and places it immediately after the modifying phr ase “ a pioneer …fossils. ” In

Choice A is incorr ect because it r esults in a dangling modiﬁer . The placement of the noun phr ase “fossils of thin-shelled

Rationale
Choice D is the best answer . The subject of the v erb is “Lincoln, ” and the ﬁrst sentence tells us that we ’re talking about something
that Abr aham Lincoln did in 1860. So the simple past tense “le veraged” ﬁts the logic of the text.
Choice A is incorr ect. This choice cr eates a tense issue. “Has le veraged” is the pr esent per fect tense, which is used for an action
that began in the past and continues int o the pr esent. Lincoln star ted le veraging his riv als’ talents in 1860—it’ s deﬁnitely not still
happening t oday. So the pr esent per fect tense isn ’t appr opriate. Choice B is incorr ect. This choice cr eates a tense issue. “Is
leveraging” is the pr esent tense, but Lincoln le veraged his riv als’ talents in 1860, so the pr esent tense isn ’t appr opriate. Choice C is
incorr ect. This choice cr eates a tense issue. “Will le verage” is the futur e tense, but Lincoln le veraged his riv als’ talents in 1860, so

Choice C is the best answer . The conv ention being tested is the punctuation of items in a complex series. It’ s conv entional t o use
a semicolon t o separ ate items in a complex series with internal punctuation, and in this choice, the semicolon after “2009” is
conv entionally used t o separ ate the ﬁrst item (“the world’ s…2009”) and the second item (“ an online…2010”) in the series of things
that Hinson helped cr eate. F urther, the comma after “Basic ” corr ectly pairs with the comma after “ app,” and the comma after
“network” corr ectly pairs with the comma after “T V” to set off the supplemental elements (“Chickasaw Basic ” and “Chickasaw
TV”) that pr ovide the names of the app and the TV network, r espectiv ely. Altogether , the punctuation in this choice r esults in a
sentence that clearly indicates that Hinson helped mak e a language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language
course in 2015.  
Choice A is incorr ect because it fails t o punctuate the complex series in a wa y that mak es clear that Hinson helped mak e a
language app in 2009, an online TV network in 2010, and a language course in 2015. Choice B is incorr ect because it fails t o
punctuate the complex series in a wa y that mak es clear that Hinson helped mak e a language app in 2009, an online TV network in
2010, and a language course in 2015. Choice D is incorr ect because the comma after “2009” doesn ’t match the semicolon used t o
separ ate the second and thir d items in the complex series.
